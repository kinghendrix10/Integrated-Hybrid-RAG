PENNSYLVANIA STATE POLICE ______________ On Appeal from the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania (D.C. Civ. No. 1-09-cv-02549) Honorable Christopher C. Conner, District Judge ______________ Submitted under Third Circuit LAR 34.1(a) December 12, 2014 BEFORE: VANASKIE, GREENBERG, and COWEN, Circuit Judges (Filed: January 8, 2015) ______________ OPINION * ______________ GREENBERG, Circuit Judge. I. INTRODUCTION ____________________ * This disposition is not an opinion of the full Court and pursuant to I.O.P. 5.7 does not constitute binding precedent. Plaintiff, Tony Reaves, claims that his former employer, the Pennsylvania State Police (\\u201cPSP\\u201d), dismissed him in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\\u201cTitle VII\\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2000e et seq., in retaliation for Reaves having made complaints of racial discrimination. PSP made a motion for summary judgment, which the District Court granted as it concluded that Reaves could not establish that there was a causal connection between his complaints and his subsequent dismissal. Reaves has appealed, but we agree with the Court\\u2019s conclusion and therefore will affirm its order for summary judgment entered on February 6, 2014. II. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND Reaves, who is African American, graduated from the Pennsylvania State Police Academy in April 2006, and became a probationary PSP trooper. The PSP probationary trooper program enables supervisors to make a comprehensive in-depth evaluation of a new trooper. The program includes periodic written evaluations of the probationary trooper\\u2019s on-the-job conduct, as well as a general investigation (GI) report compiled near the end of the probationary period. The GI report is a review of the trooper\\u2019s performance and includes a recommendation of whether PSP should retain the trooper. When Reaves graduated from the academy, PSP assigned him to Troop J Lancaster, Avondale Station, where his immediate supervisor was Corporal Erin Magee, his station commander was Lieutenant Sheldon Sneed, and his troop commander was Captain John Laufer. Magee\\u2019s notes from that period state that in May 2006, Reaves was stopped by a trooper from a different station for speeding and that in August 2006, he 2 was stopped by a trooper from yet another station for a minor traffic violation. During that period, Magee counseled Reaves that he had acted unprofessionally in relation to an incident involving radio etiquette and that he needed to improve his reputation among coworkers and the public. In September 2006, Magee prepared Reaves\\u2019s first probationary evaluation, which rated him as \\u201csatisfactory\\u201d in nine categories and \\u201cborderline \\u2013 needs improvement\\u201d in six. Magee noted that Reaves, at times, had \\u201cdisplayed a certain arrogance or lack of respect towards co-workers\\u201d and had \\u201cnot always used good tact while interacting with his co-workers and supervisors.\\u201d App. 1236, 1245. Magee prepared Reaves\\u2019s second evaluation in November 2006, rating him as \\u201csatisfactory\\u201d in twelve categories and \\u201cborderline \\u2013 needs improvement\\u201d in three. Magee noted improvement in Reaves\\u2019s sensitivity and tact towards others but stated that he still needed to improve in this area. Later that month, Corporal Steven Ranck replaced Magee as Reaves\\u2019s immediate supervisor. Ranck prepared Reaves\\u2019s third evaluation in January 2007, rating him as \\u201csatisfactory\\u201d in fourteen categories and \\u201cborderline \\u2013 needs improvement\\u201d only in the category of job knowledge. Ranck opined that Reaves had made the necessary improvements with respect to his attitude and deportment towards others. On January 23, 2007, Ranck prepared a GI report in which he recommended that PSP retain Reaves. Most of the persons interviewed for the report, including some who identified certain problems with Reaves\\u2019s attitude and reports, recommended retaining Reaves. One officer, however, did not recommend retaining Reaves, describing him as 3 \\u201cso aggressive that he suffers from tunnel vision and makes poor decisions while on the road,\\u201d and stating that Reaves \\u201chas also displayed poor acceptance of criticism and a lack of respect for supervisors.\\u201d App. 1383. Sneed likewise recommended retaining Reaves, but, after reviewing the GI report and Sneed\\u2019s supplemental report, Laufer recommended that PSP extend his probationary period for six months. On March 14, 2007, the Probationary Trooper Review Panel (\\u201cPTRP\\u201d) considered Laufer\\u2019s recommendation and similarly concluded that Reaves\\u2019s probation should be extended. The PTRP emphasized the problems identified regarding Reaves\\u2019s attitude and reports, as well as the fact that Reaves had been stopped for traffic violations on two separate occasions.1 On March 26, the Probationary Trooper Administrative Review Panel (\\u201cPTARP\\u201d) agreed that PSP should extend Reaves\\u2019s probationary period.2 PSP notified Reaves of its decision, and Reaves\\u2019s then acting station commander informed him that his attitude and demeanor toward others would be \\u201cmonitored closely\\u201d during the ensuing six-month extension period. App. 622, 1224-25. Reaves believed he was being discriminated against due to his race when PSP extended his probationary term. Accordingly, on April 12, 2007, he contacted Lieutenant Martin Henry of PSP\\u2019s Equal Employment Opportunity Office, and complained of his treatment. He contacted Henry ten more times through August of that year. In looking into Reaves\\u2019s complaints, Henry spoke with both Sneed and Laufer. 1 All of the traffic stops that we describe in this opinion took place while Reaves was off duty, driving a private vehicle. 2 The PTRP and PTARP consist of senior officers. 4 Meanwhile, Ranck prepared Reaves\\u2019s fourth probationary evaluation on March 7, 2007, rating him as satisfactory in all categories, including attitude. Ranck prepared Reaves\\u2019s fifth evaluation that May, again rating him as satisfactory in all categories. On July 21, 2007, PSP troopers stopped Reaves again, this time for speeding and passing a state police car on the right. Given Reaves\\u2019s history of traffic stops, and after consultation with Laufer, Sneed initiated a formal investigation into this incident. Sneed also directed Ranck to look into the details of Reaves\\u2019s previous traffic stops and to run an offline registration search of Reaves\\u2019s vehicle to determine if he had been involved in any other traffic stops. The investigation led Reaves to complain to Ranck in August 2007 that he believed he was being treated differently than other troopers. Thereafter, Reaves also made both verbal and written complaints of discrimination to Sneed, who forwarded Reaves\\u2019s complaint to Laufer. While investigating the July 2007 traffic stop, Ranck learned of an incident from November 2006 in which Reaves allegedly acted \\u201cnasty, demanding and very arrogant\\u201d toward a sergeant. App. 104. Additionally, the offline registration search of Reaves\\u2019s vehicle revealed that the license plate on Reaves\\u2019s truck, which was registered to his grandfather, had been run 29 times since Reaves started at the police academy. As required due to the extension of Reaves\\u2019s probation, Ranck began preparing a second GI report. The report included information about the July 2007 traffic stop and the November 2006 incident between Reaves and the sergeant. A majority of the individuals interviewed still recommended retaining Reaves, but some now made 5 contrary recommendations. Several officers noted a decline in the quality of Reaves\\u2019s reports. Magee, now a sergeant, also stated that Reaves\\u2019s demeanor remained a problem. Ranck concluded that Reaves should not be retained. He expressed concern that Reaves\\u2019s off-duty conduct in relation to the repeated traffic stops showed a poor attitude: \\u201cI believe that if Trooper Reaves is willing to behave poorly off duty while under the scrutiny of probation, the problems will only continue and possibly increase once his probation has ended. I feel that Trooper Reaves\\u2019 off duty behavior will jeopardize the Department\\u2019s image.\\u201d App. 1440. On August 17, 2007, Sneed reviewed the GI report and prepared his own report recommending that PSP not retain Reaves. Sneed stated that despite repeated discussions with Reaves regarding the need to improve his demeanor, Reaves continued to speak to people in an arrogant manner. Between August 24 and September 13, Ranck prepared three supplements to the GI report. These supplements provided further information regarding the two traffic stops during Reaves\\u2019s initial probationary period, Ranck\\u2019s offline registration search and follow-up investigation, and an additional traffic stop on March 12, 2007. On September 13, Laufer reviewed Reaves\\u2019s GI reports and supplements, and issued a recommendation that PSP not retain Reaves. Laufer stated that despite some improvement in areas previously identified as problematic, Reaves\\u2019s attitude and his own conformance to the law remained concerns. Laufer emphasized the multiple traffic stops and the lack of respect for the PSP and Pennsylvania law that these incidents reflected, and concluded that this \\u201cpattern of conduct\\u201d while on probation indicated serious 6 behavioral and attitudinal issues. App. 1420. The area commander for Reaves\\u2019s troop, the PTRP, and the PTARP each agreed with the recommendation to dismiss Reaves. The PSP commissioner signed off on this decision on October 2, and Sneed notified Reaves of his dismissal two days later. For record-keeping purposes, Ranck prepared Reaves\\u2019s sixth probationary evaluation, which Ranck signed on October 3. Ranck rated Reaves\\u2019s attitude as \\u201cunsatisfactory.\\u201d In discussing Reaves\\u2019s attitude, Ranck wrote: \\u201cTrooper Reaves has also recently displayed a negative attitude towards the Department. He has advised me that he feels that there is a double standard used regarding him and that he gets Bureau of Professional Responsibility complaints for his actions and others get nothing for the same thing or worse. However when asked to supply specific instances so that I could look into such things he has been unable/unwilling to provide specifics.\\u201d App. 1324. Given that Ranck did not sign this evaluation until after the commissioner consented to Reaves\\u2019s dismissal, the evaluation did not play a role in the decision to dismiss Reaves. Reaves sued PSP in the District Court, asserting claims of race discrimination and retaliation, both in violation of Title VII. PSP moved for summary judgment on both causes of action. Initially, the Court, adopting in part and rejecting in part a report and recommendation from a magistrate judge, granted the motion with respect to the discrimination claim but denied it with respect to the retaliation claim. See Reaves v. Pa. State Police, No. 1:09-CV-2549, 2012 WL 4970225, at *7 (M.D. Pa. Oct. 17, 2012). In that opinion, however, the Court did not address whether Reaves could show that there was a causal connection between his complaints of differential treatment and his 7 subsequent dismissal to support a claim of retaliation. PSP moved for reconsideration based on the causation issue, and the Court granted the motion for reconsideration and granted summary judgment for PSP. See Reaves v. Pa. State Police, No. 1:09-CV-2549, 2014 WL 486741, at *1 (M.D. Pa. Feb. 6, 2014). Reaves then filed this appeal limited to his retaliation claim. III. STATEMENT OF JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW The District Court had jurisdiction over Reaves\\u2019s Title VII claims pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2000e-5(f)(3) and 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 1331 and 1343. We have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1291. On an appeal from an order granting summary judgment, we exercise plenary review and apply the same standard as the district court. See Budhun v. Reading Hosp. & Med. Ctr., 765 F.3d 245, 251 (3d Cir. 2014). To warrant summary judgment, the movant must show \\u201cthat there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). In applying this standard, we view the evidence \\u201cin the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and draw all inferences in that party\\u2019s favor.\\u201d Spence v. ESAB Grp., Inc., 623 F.3d 212, 216 (3d Cir. 2010). However, \\u201cthe mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the nonmovant\\u2019s position will be insufficient; there must be evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the nonmovant.\\u201d Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 252, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2512 (1986). 8 IV. DISCUSSION Title VII prohibits employers from retaliating against employees for complaining about certain unlawful employment practices, including discrimination on the basis of race. See 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2000e-3. We consider claims of retaliation like the one at issue here, where there is not direct evidence of retaliation, using the three-step burden-shifting framework set out in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817 (1973). See McKenna v. City of Phila., 649 F.3d 171, 178 n.7 (3d Cir. 2011); Moore v. City of Phila., 461 F.3d 331, 342 (3d Cir. 2006). Under this framework, the plaintiff first must establish by a preponderance of the evidence a prima facie case of retaliation; the burden of production of evidence then shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for taking the adverse action against the plaintiff; finally, the burden rebounds to the plaintiff to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the proffered reason constitutes a pretext for retaliation. See Marra v. Phila. Hous. Auth., 497 F.3d 286, 300-01 (3d Cir. 2007); Moore, 461 F.3d at 342. But the plaintiff always has the ultimate burden of persuasion. Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods. Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 143, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 2106 (2000). To establish a prima facie case of retaliation, a plaintiff must show that (1) he engaged in conduct protected by Title VII; (2) the employer took an adverse action against the plaintiff either after or contemporaneously with the protected activity; and (3) a causal connection exists between the protected activity and the adverse action. See Wilkerson v. New Media Tech. Charter Sch. Inc., 522 F.3d 315, 320 (3d Cir. 2008); Andreoli v. Gates, 482 F.3d 641, 649 (3d Cir. 2007). The District Court held, and the 9 parties do not dispute, that Reaves satisfied the first two elements of his prima facie case based on his complaints of differential treatment to Henry, Ranck, and Sneed, and his subsequent dismissal from PSP. The District Court concluded, however, that Reaves could not establish that there was a causal connection between his complaints and his dismissal. We agree with this conclusion. Title VII retaliation claims require proof that the plaintiff\\u2019s participation in a protected activity constituted a but-for cause of the employer\\u2019s adverse action. See Univ. of Tex. Sw. Med. Ctr. v. Nassar, 133 S.Ct. 2517, 2533 (2013); LeBoon v. Lancaster Jewish Cmty. Ctr. Ass\\u2019n, 503 F.3d 217, 232 n.8 (3d Cir. 2007); Woodson v. Scott Paper Co., 109 F.3d 913, 935 (3d Cir. 1997). We consider \\u201ca broad array of evidence\\u201d in determining whether the plaintiff can show the requisite causal link. LeBoon, 503 F.3d at 232 (quoting Farrell v. Planters Lifesavers Co., 206 F.3d 271, 284 (3d Cir. 2000)). Such evidence may include a temporal proximity between the protected activity and the adverse action, antagonistic behavior on the part of the employer, inconsistencies in the employer\\u2019s articulated reasons for taking the adverse action, or any other evidence that supports an inference of retaliatory animus. See id. at 232-33; Abramson v. William Paterson Coll. of N.J., 260 F.3d 265, 288-89 (3d Cir. 2001); Farrell, 206 F.3d at 280-81. However, \\u201can employee cannot easily establish a causal connection between his protected activity and the alleged retaliation when he has received significant negative evaluations before engaging in the protected activity.\\u201d Ross v. Gilhuly, 755 F.3d 185, 194 (3d Cir. 2014). In Ross, we held that an employee could not establish a causal link between his protected activity and his ultimate termination, where the reasons that the 10 employer contemporaneously gave for the termination were deficiencies that it had identified in performance evaluations even prior to the employee\\u2019s protected activity. See id.; see also LeBoon, 503 F.3d at 233-34 (affirming summary judgment because employee could not show prima facie causation based on tense relationship with her supervisor where this tense relationship predated employee\\u2019s protected activity); Shaner v. Synthes, 204 F.3d 494, 504-05 (3d Cir. 2000) (holding that negative performance evaluation after employee\\u2019s protected activity did not support causal link so as to survive a summary judgment motion where earlier evaluations contained similar criticisms). Here, the reasons PSP gave for dismissing Reaves matched its reasons for extending his probation prior to his complaints of discrimination. In both instances, PSP emphasized problems with Reaves\\u2019s attitude, reports, and off-duty conduct, including his traffic stops. Reaves points to certain of his supervisors\\u2019 evaluations as evidence that he had resolved his attitudinal issues before his dismissal, but most of the evidence he cites predated his probation extension and therefore does not support an inference that Reaves had remedied the problems that led to the extension of his probation. Similarly, although Ranck rated Reaves as having a \\u201csatisfactory\\u201d attitude in his first two probation evaluations after Laufer first recommended the probation extension, these evaluations do not establish that there was improvement on Reaves\\u2019s part as Ranck gave him the same rating in his last evaluation before Laufer\\u2019s recommendation. See Fuentes v. Perskie, 32 F.3d 759, 767 (3d Cir. 1994) (citing Ezold v. Wolf, Block, Schorr & Solis-Cohen, 983 F.2d 509, 533 (3d Cir. 1992)) (noting that relevant decisionmakers often disagree about an employee\\u2019s qualifications and that such disagreement does not evidence 11 discriminatory intent). Furthermore, these evaluations preceded Reaves\\u2019s July 2007 traffic stop, after which Ranck learned of the more extensive problems with Reaves\\u2019s attitude and off-duty conduct. Reaves contends that the increased scrutiny and investigation that uncovered these more extensive problems resulted from retaliatory animus, but he does not present adequate evidence to support this claim. As Reaves acknowledges, PSP informed him at the time it extended his probation that he would be \\u201cmonitored closely\\u201d during the ensuing period. Appellant\\u2019s br. 15. PSP initiated its investigation into Reaves\\u2019s off-duty conduct only after learning of his involvement in a third off-duty traffic stop during his probationary period. Reaves provides no evidence that such an investigation was unusual for a trooper who continued to have problems with off-duty conduct after PSP extended his probation in part because of such conduct. The only evidence of retaliatory animus that Reaves identifies is that in his last probationary evaluation, Ranck cited Reaves\\u2019s complaints of differential treatment as one of the examples of his unsatisfactory attitude. However, this isolated comment, signed after PSP already had finalized its decision to dismiss Reaves, does not by itself constitute sufficient evidence of a retaliatory motive for Reaves to survive the motion for summary judgment. See Estate of Oliva ex rel. McHugh v. New Jersey, 604 F.3d 788, 799 (3d Cir. 2010) (affirming summary judgment for employer and declaring that commander\\u2019s comment, after twice transferring plaintiff, that he was \\u201cpissed\\u201d at plaintiff for making certain statements did not provide adequate \\u201cfoundation on which a reasonable factfinder could predicate a finding that the transfers were in retaliation for\\u201d plaintiff\\u2019s earlier complaints); Woodson, 109 F.3d at 921-22 12 (noting that suggestion by employer\\u2019s director of human resources that plaintiff drop his equal employment opportunity suits would not alone suffice to establish prima facie causal link); Ezold, 983 F.2d at 545 (\\u201cStray remarks by non-decisionmakers or by decisionmakers unrelated to the decision process are rarely given great weight . . . .\\u201d). V. CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the District Court\\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of PSP entered on February 6, 2014. 13\",\n          \"parties: Lawrence WRIGHT, Plaintiff, v.

II. STANDARD OF REVIEW Before granting a motion for summary judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56, a court must find that \\u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). \\u201cA fact is material if it might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law, and a dispute about a material fact is genuine if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\\u201d Steele v. Schafer, 535 F.3d 689, 692 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (quoting Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986) (internal quotation marks omitted). When ruling on a motion for summary judgment, \\u201cthe evidence of the non-movant is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in his favor.\\u201d Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255 (citation omitted). \\u201cCredibility determinations, the weighing of the evidence, and the drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts are jury functions, not those of a judge . . . ruling on a motion for summary judgment . . . .\\u201d Id. The movant has the burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact and that the non-moving party \\u201cfailed to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party\\u2019s case, and on 5 which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.\\u201d Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986). In responding to a summary judgment motion, the non-moving party \\u201cmust do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.\\u201d Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586 (1986). Accordingly, the non-moving party must not rely on \\u201cmere allegations or denials . . . but . . . must set forth specific facts showing that there are genuine issues for trial.\\u201d Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248 (second omission in original) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). \\u201cThe mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the non-moving party\\u2019s position is insufficient\\u201d to withstand a motion for summary judgment, but rather \\u201cthere must be some evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the non-movant.\\u201d Id. at 252. III. ANALYSIS In the absence of direct evidence of discrimination, as is the situation here, claims of employment discrimination under Title VII are analyzed under the three-part framework of McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973). See Jackson v. Gonzales, 496 F.3d 703, 706 (D.C. Cir. 2007). Under this framework, the plaintiff bears the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination, by providing proof of \\u201c(1) membership in a protected group; (2) qualification for the job in question; (3) an adverse employment action; and (4) circumstances that support an inference of discrimination.\\u201d Swierkeiewicz v. Sorema N.A., 534 U.S. 506, 510 (2002) (citations omitted). If the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, \\u201cthe burden then must shift to the employer to articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action.\\u201d McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802. Once the employer offers a legitimate, nondiscriminatory justification for its action, \\u201cthe McDonnell 6 Douglas framework\\u2014with its presumptions and burdens\\u2014disappears, and the sole remaining issue is discrimination vel non.\\u201d Jackson, 496 F.3d at 707 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). After the employer makes such a showing, \\u201cthe plaintiff must prove that a reasonable jury could infer that the employer\\u2019s given explanation was pretextual and that this pretext shielded discriminatory motives.\\u201d Id. (citations omitted). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the defendant \\u201chas asserted a legitimate, non- discriminatory reason\\u201d for the adverse employment action in a motion for summary judgment, \\u201cthe district court need not\\u2014and should not\\u2014decide whether the plaintiff actually made out a prima facie case under McDonnell Douglas.\\u201d Brady v. Office of the Sergeant at Arms, 520 F.3d 490, 494 (D.C. Cir. 2008). Rather, the Court should evaluate only whether \\u201cthe employee has produced sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find that the employer\\u2019s asserted non- discriminatory reason was not the actual reason and that the employer intentionally discriminated against the employee on the basis of race.\\u201d Evans v. Sebelius, 716 F.3d 617, 620 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (citation omitted). If the plaintiff fails to present such evidence, summary judgment must be granted for the employer. Paquin v. Fed. Nat\\u2019l Mortg. Ass\\u2019n, 119 F.3d 23, 27-28 (D.C. Cir. 1997). A. The Defendant\\u2019s Stated Reason for Termination The defendant maintains that it terminated the plaintiff because he \\u201cdid not show up to work and was tardy in excess of the allowance\\u201d under the defendant\\u2019s attendance and punctuality procedures. Def.\\u2019s Mem. at 7. According to the defendant\\u2019s Amended Policy, employees are terminated after accumulating eight occurrences, Def.\\u2019s Facts \\u00b6\\u00b6 10, 14, 16; Def.\\u2019s Reply at 3; Def.\\u2019s Mot, Ex. 1 (Bieler Decl.), Ex. 5 (Amended Policy) at 25, and the defendant claims that it issued the plaintiff more than eight occurrences prior to his termination, Def.\\u2019s Facts \\u00b6 16. The 7 record contains adequate documentation to support the defendant\\u2019s decision to issue each occurrence. See Def.\\u2019s Mot., Ex. 1 (Bieler Decl.), Ex. 7 (Employee Disciplinary Report for February 16, 2009 Incident) (noting that the plaintiff was absent from work on February 16, 2009); id., Ex. 8 (Employee Disciplinary Report for March 9, 2009 Incident) (noting that the plaintiff was absent from work); id., Ex. 9 (Employee Disciplinary Report for May 2, 2009 Incident) (noting that the plaintiff was absent from work on May 2, 2009); id., Ex. 11 (June 1, 2009-June 20, 2009 Time Detail) (noting that the plaintiff was late for work on June 6, 2009 and June 15, 2009); id., Ex. 12 (Employee Disciplinary Report for July 18, 2009 Incident) (noting that the plaintiff was absent from work on July 18, 2009). And as other members of this Court have consistently held, an employee\\u2019s \\u201cfailure to meet the attendance and punctuality requirements of the job\\u201d constitutes a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for termination. Williams v. Verizon Wash., D.C., Inc., 266 F. Supp. 2d 107, 121 (D.D.C. 2003); see also Clarke v. Wash. Metro. Area Transit Auth., 904 F. Supp. 2d 11, 16 (D.D.C. 2012) (employee\\u2019s persistent tardiness is a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for termination). The Court therefore concludes that the defendant has articulated a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the plaintiff\\u2019s termination. B. The Plaintiff\\u2019s Allegations of Pretext The defendant having presented evidence that establishes a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the plaintiff\\u2019s termination, the Court must determine whether the plaintiff \\u201chas produced enough evidence to convince a jury that the defendant\\u2019s stated reason for firing him . . . is a mere pretext for what was actually race discrimination.\\u201d Wheeler v. Georgetown Univ. Hosp., ___ F. Supp. 2d ___, ___, 2014 WL 2919014, at *5 (D.D.C. 2014). Typically, plaintiffs rely on one of two types of evidence to establish pretext: (1) \\u201cthe employee may attempt to 8 demonstrate that the employer is making up or lying about the underlying facts that formed the predicate for the employment decision,\\u201d or (2) \\u201cthe employee attempts to produce evidence suggesting that the employer treated other employees of a different race, color, religion, sex, or national origin more favorably in the same factual circumstances.\\u201d See Brady, 520 F.3d at 495 (citations omitted); see also Wheeler, 2014 WL 2919014, at *6 (\\u201cPlaintiffs typically take one of two approaches in attempting to undermine an employer\\u2019s stated reason for their termination.\\u201d (citations omitted)). Conclusory allegations of discriminatory animus lacking any factual basis in the record are insufficient to defeat summary judgment. See Hussain v. Nicholson, 435 F.3d 359, 365 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (concluding that the district court properly disregarded the plaintiff\\u2019s \\u201cevidence of religious animus\\u201d because it \\u201cconsisted merely of conclusory allegations in his own affidavit\\u201d (citation omitted)). 1. Allegations of Fabrication The plaintiff first questions the legitimacy of several of the occurrences he received for his absences during 2009. While the plaintiff concedes that he was absent from work on February 16, 2009, he argues that he should not have received two occurrences because he \\u201ccalled Troy Mills\\u2019s company cell phone and advised him that he would be absent from work\\u201d on that day. Pl.\\u2019s Facts \\u00b6 30; Pl.\\u2019s Opp\\u2019n at 12. Similarly, the plaintiff argues that he should not have received two occurrences for his absence from work on Saturday, July 18, 2009, because he had already accumulated too many hours that week and \\u201cshould not have been scheduled to work.\\u201d Pl.\\u2019s Facts \\u00b6 41-43; Pl.\\u2019s Opp\\u2019n at 12. Furthermore, he claims that on July 18, 2009, he \\u201ccalled and spoke to Brenda Garcia, the route manager on duty, and told her he had a flat tire.\\u201d Pl.\\u2019s Facts \\u00b6 44. The defendant asserts that it properly issued two occurrences for each of these absences according to the terms of its Policy and Amended Policy. Def.\\u2019s Facts \\u00b6\\u00b6 11, 16. 9 The plaintiff does not dispute his absenteeism, see Def.\\u2019s Mot., Ex. 4 (Wright Depo.) at 61:5-9 (plaintiff testifying that he was absent from work on these days), and the issuance of these occurrences comports with the defendant\\u2019s attendance policies, Def.\\u2019s Mot., Ex. 1 (Bieler Decl.), Ex. 4 (Policy) at 24 (providing for the issuance of two occurrences for any shift that is missed on a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, or Monday); id., Ex. 5 (Amended Policy) at 25 (same). \\u201cIf an employer\\u2019s stated belief about the underlying facts is reasonable in light of the evidence . . . there ordinarily is no basis for permitting a jury to conclude that the employer is lying about the facts.\\u201d Brady, 520 F.3d at 495 (citing George v. Leavitt, 407 F.3d 405, 415 (D.C. Cir. 2005)). Thus, a Court will \\u201cnot second-guess an employer\\u2019s personnel decision absent demonstrably discriminatory motive.\\u201d Fischbach v. D.C. Dept. of Corr., 86 F.3d 1180, 1183 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, even if the defendant\\u2019s application of its attendance policies was mistaken or flawed in some way, \\u201can employer\\u2019s action may be justified by a reasonable belief in the validity of the reason given even though that reason may turn out to be false.\\u201d George, 407 F.3d at 415; see also Fischbach, 86 F.3d at 1183 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted) (\\u201cIt is not enough for the plaintiff to show that a reason given for a job action is not just, or fair, or sensible. He must show that the explanation given is a phony reason.\\u201d). The plaintiff has failed to articulate any reason for this Court to find that the defendant\\u2019s issuances of the occurrences for the absences on February 16, 2009, and July 18, 2009, were based on phony reasoning or were in any way connected with his race. Accordingly, the plaintiff\\u2019s allegations that these occurrences demonstrate pretext are meritless. See, e.g., Chambliss v. Nat\\u2019l R.R. Passenger Corp., No. 05-2490 (CKK), 2007 WL 581900, at *21 (D.D.C. Feb. 20, 2007) (plaintiff failed to establish pretext where his \\u201cown descriptions of incidents of 10 disciplinary action for tardiness and absenteeism fail to show that these incidents were in any way connected to the plaintiff\\u2019s race\\u201d). With respect to the occurrences issued for his two instances of tardiness in June 2009, the plaintiff contends that the \\u201cdefendant\\u2019s persistent prevarication . . . raises substantial issues about the credibility of the defendant\\u2019s justification for the plaintiff\\u2019s termination.\\u201d Pl.\\u2019s Opp\\u2019n at 14. Yet, the defendant has submitted ample evidence to establish that the plaintiff was, in fact, tardy on June 6, 2009, and June 15, 2009, see Def.\\u2019s Mot., Ex. 1 (Bieler Decl.) \\u00b6 8; Id., Ex. 11 (Time Detail) at 24 (noting the exact times that the plaintiff arrived to work on the days in question); Def.\\u2019s Mot., Ex. 2 (Mills Decl.) \\u00b6 8; Def.\\u2019s Mot., Ex. 3 (Smith Decl.) \\u00b6 8; Def.\\u2019s Mot., Ex. 5, (Deposition of Troy Mills (\\u201cMills Depo.\\u201d)) at 127-132; Def.\\u2019s Facts \\u00b6 15, and the plaintiff neither disputes these claims nor offers any affidavits or other evidence to find to the contrary. 4 In accordance with its Amended Policy, the defendant asserts that it issued one half of an occurrence for the tardiness on June 6, 2009, and one occurrence for the tardiness on June 15, 2009. See Def.\\u2019s Mot., Ex. 1 (Bieler Decl.) \\u00b6 8. To support his claim that the June 2009 occurrences were fabricated, the plaintiff alleges that the defendant did not produce \\u201cany written record contemporaneous with the plaintiff\\u2019s termination that the June occurrences were, in part, the basis for the termination,\\u201d and that Troy Mills improperly indicated during his deposition \\u201cthat the defendant was not required to provide written notice of the June adverse employment actions\\u201d when the absences occurred. Pl.\\u2019s Opp\\u2019n at 14. But according to the defendant\\u2019s Amended Policy, \\u201cwarnings are issued to 4 In his Statement of Material Facts in Dispute, the plaintiff summarily \\u201cdenies\\u201d the defendant\\u2019s statements in paragraph 15 of its Statement of Undisputed Material Facts. Pl.\\u2019s Facts \\u00b6 15. For this denial, the plaintiff cites to his own declaration submitted in support of his opposition, wherein he objects only to the fact that he allegedly \\u201creceived notice from Troy Mills that he had earned occurrences in June 2009,\\u201d and does not dispute his tardiness on these days. Pl.\\u2019s Opp\\u2019n, Ex. A (Wright Decl.) \\u00b6 2. And as previously noted, a non-moving party may not rely exclusively on \\u201cmere allegations or denials . . . but . . . must set forth specific facts showing that there are genuine issues for trial.\\u201d Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248 (second omission in original) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). 11 employees only for the second, fourth, sixth, and eighth occurrences.\\u201d Def.\\u2019s Reply at 5; Def.\\u2019s Mot., Ex. 1 (Bieler Decl.), Ex. 5 (Amended Policy) at 25; Def.\\u2019s Mot., Ex. 5 (Mills Depo.) at 131:31-32 (testifying that a supervisor \\u201cdoes not meet with a driver or any hourly employee after every occurrence\\u201d). The plaintiff \\u201cwas not given a formal Employee Disciplinary Report, because he already had a written warning at his sixth occurrence on May 2, 2009, and pursuant to the Waste Management Attendance and Punctuality Policy, the next action is not until an eighth occurrence is reached.\\u201d Def.\\u2019s Mot., Ex. 1 (Bieler Decl.) \\u00b6 8. Again, the plaintiff has failed to produce any evidence which shows that the defendant\\u2019s reasons for issuing these occurrences are \\u201cphony,\\u201d see Fischbach, 86 F.3d at 1183, or were otherwise connected in any way to the plaintiff\\u2019s race, see, e.g., Chambliss, 2007 WL 581900, at *21. As \\u201cthe Court can find no evidence that would lead a reasonable jury to question the good faith of the defendant\\u2019s determination or efforts,\\u201d the Court must conclude that these allegations fail to establish pretext. See Wheeler, __ F. Supp. 2d at __, 2014 WL 2919014, at *7. Lastly, the plaintiff alleges that the defendant\\u2019s decision to excuse his absence on March 9, 2009, \\u201craises legitimate questions about Mr. Smith\\u2019s administration of the defendant\\u2019s leave and disciplinary policies.\\u201d Pl.\\u2019s Opp\\u2019n at 13-14. The plaintiff asks the Court to draw the inference that the decision to rescind the occurrences somehow demonstrates that their initial issuance relied upon \\u201cevidence that even the defendant\\u2019s HR manager deemed not only inadequate, but suspicious.\\u201d Id. at 14. But the Court finds baseless such an inference because the record lacks any factual basis to support these assertions. Under the attendance policy, the defendant issued two occurrences for each of the plaintiff\\u2019s absences in March, Def.\\u2019s Facts \\u00b6 12; Pl.\\u2019s Facts \\u00b6\\u00b6 32-33, but in May 2009, the plaintiff submitted documentation indicating that his absences were related to a medical issue with his grandson, Def.\\u2019s Facts \\u00b6 12; Pl.\\u2019s Facts \\u00b6 38. 12 As a result of this documentation, Ms. Hightower recommended rescinding the plaintiff\\u2019s two March occurrences. Def.\\u2019s Mot., Ex. 1 (Bieler Decl.), Ex. 10 (May 4, 2009-May 8, 2009 E-mail Correspondence). Management rescinded these occurrences. Def.\\u2019s Facts \\u00b6\\u00b6 13-14; Pl.\\u2019s Facts \\u00b6 40. The plaintiff offers no evidence to support the dubious inference he asks the Court to make, nor does he offer any evidence which suggests that the March 2009 occurrences were issued because of his race; therefore, the Court concludes that these allegations are also insufficient to establish pretext. See, e.g., Johnson v. Vilsack, 815 F. Supp. 2d 221, 232 (D.D.C. 2011) (\\u201cThese assertions do not suffice to rebut defendant\\u2019s legitimate, non-discriminatory explanation, not only because they are unsupported by the evidence, but also because they fail to assert that any action was taken based on plaintiff\\u2019s protected class.\\u201d). 2. Allegations of Disparate Treatment Alternatively, the plaintiff argues that the defendant\\u2019s stated reason for his termination is pretextual because he \\u201cobserved the attendance policy selectively enforced for the benefit of non-African-American drivers.\\u201d Pl.\\u2019s Facts \\u00b6 29. Yet, the plaintiff has failed to offer any comparator evidence which demonstrates that the attendance policy was selectively enforced, as he contends. Indeed, the plaintiff has not identified any non-African-American employee\\u2014or any employee at all\\u2014who violated the attendance policy and was not terminated. Def.\\u2019s Facts \\u00b6 20; Def.\\u2019s Mot., Ex. 4 (Wright Depo.) at 66:13-20. And where, as here, the plaintiff fails to identify any similarly-situated comparators, \\u201can inference of falsity or discrimination is not reasonable.\\u201d Montgomery v. Chao, 546 F.3d 703, 707 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Instead, the plaintiff relies exclusively on the statistic that \\u201cwithin the two years after the closing of the Temple Hills facility 60% of African-American drivers who had transferred to 13 Gaithersburg had been terminated for cause or Reduction-in-Force.\\u201d Pl.\\u2019s Facts \\u00b6 49; Pl.\\u2019s Opp\\u2019n, Ex. G (Employees Transferred from Temple Hills to Gaithersburg). While statistical evidence may be \\u201crelevant\\u201d in individual disparate treatment cases, \\u201ccourts have consistently emphasized that the ultimate issue is the reasons for the individual plaintiff\\u2019s treatment, not the relative treatment of different groups within the workplace.\\u201d Horvath v. Thompson, 329 F. Supp. 2d 1, 10 (D.D.C. 2004) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, such evidence is \\u201cordinarily not dispositive,\\u201d id. (citations and internal quotation marks omitted), and \\u201cabsent a showing of their significance, the plaintiff\\u2019s numbers are simply irrelevant,\\u201d id. at 11 (citation omitted). The plaintiff\\u2019s evidence \\u201ccould be relevant to showing discrimination if it demonstrated a disparity\\u201d in the treatment of employees based on race, see id., but fails to do so here because it lacks any comparisons to similarly-situated non-African Americans. Therefore, the Court has no way of determining whether this statistic is \\u201cdisproportionately small to the pool, disproportionately large, or approximately statistically perfect.\\u201d See Whitacre v. Davey, 890 F.2d 1168, 1172 (D.C. Cir. 1989). Accordingly, the plaintiff\\u2019s claims of selective enforcement are unavailing because he has failed to offer any evidence to suggest that similarly-situated non-African-Americans were treated differently under the defendant\\u2019s Amended Policy. See, e.g., McGill v. Munoz, 203 F.3d 843, 848 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (the plaintiff did not demonstrate pretext when she failed to offer any \\u201cevidence that employees with similarly suspicious patterns of absenteeism were treated any differently than she was\\u201d). Moreover, the plaintiff\\u2019s assertions of disparate treatment are further undercut by the fact that the defendant replaced the plaintiff by hiring Kenneth R. Eldridge, an African-American, Def.\\u2019s Facts \\u00b6 6; Def.\\u2019s Mot., Ex. 1 (Bieler Decl.) \\u00b6 12; Def.\\u2019s Mot., Ex. 2 (Mills Decl.) \\u00b6 12; Def.\\u2019s Mot., Ex. 3 (Smith Decl.) \\u00b6 12, because \\u201ca replacement within the 14 same protected class cuts strongly against any inference of discrimination,\\u201d Brannum v. Fed. Nat\\u2019l Mortg. Ass\\u2019n, 971 F. Supp. 2d 120, 127 (D.D.C. 2013) (quoting Murray v. Gilmore, 406 F.3d 708, 715 (D.C Cir. 2005)). 5 IV. CONCLUSION The defendant in this matter has stated a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the plaintiff\\u2019s termination. The plaintiff having failed to produce evidence sufficient to allow a reasonable jury to conclude that this proffered reason for his termination was a pretext designed to veil racial discrimination, the Court concludes that it must grant summary judgment for the defendant.

(\\u201cTitle VII\\u201d); 2) employment discrimination on the basis of retaliation pursuant to Title VII; 3) hostile work environment pursuant to Title VII; 4) constructive discharge/wrongful termination; and 5) equitable relief. Defendant Jeh Johnson, 1 Secretary of the United States Department of Homeland Security, moved for dismissal of the Complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim and for summary judgment under Rule 56 on Count IV (ECF No. 10, the \\u201cMotion\\u201d). In the Motion, the Secretary argues that Executive Branch security clearance decisions are committed by law to the \\u201cbroad discretion\\u201d of the Executive Branch agency responsible and are not subject to judicial review, citing Dep\\u2019t of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527-29 (1988). (Mot. at 9\\u201317). In his Opposition, Mr. Hendrix acknowledges the effect of Egan and \\u201cvoluntarily agrees to dismiss 1 Mr. Hendrix\\u2019s Complaint names as Defendant Janet Napolitano, in her capacity as Secretary of the United States Department of Homeland Security. Ms. Napolitano has since resigned. Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 25(d), Mr. Johnson, who currently holds this office, is automatically substituted as Defendant. 1 Counts I \\u2013 III of his Complaint.\\u201d (ECF No. 13, Opp\\u2019n at 15). The scope of the Court\\u2019s analysis, therefore, is limited to Counts IV and V of the Complaint. Because the facts and law present but one outcome on Count IV, the Court enters summary judgment on it in the Secretary\\u2019s favor. The Court must dismiss Count V for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. I. RELEVANT UNDISPUTED MATERIAL FACTS The following facts are undisputed by the parties. Mr. Hendrix, who is African- American, was employed in the United States Secret Service\\u2019s Los Angeles Field Office (\\u201cFO\\u201d) at the time of his retirement on September 30, 2012. 2 (ECF No. 1, Compl., \\u00b6 15; Mot. 1 \\u00b6 1; Opp\\u2019n 9). On October 1, 2010, Mr. Hendrix received a Notice from the Chief of the Secret Service\\u2019s Security Clearance Division (\\u201cSCD\\u201d) that his Top Secret security clearance was being suspended because additional time was needed to resolve adverse information regarding Mr. Hendrix\\u2019s alleged misuse of the Baltimore FO\\u2019s Confidential Fund and to conduct additional investigation. (Compl. \\u00b6 44; Mot. 2 \\u00b6 5; Opp\\u2019n 10). Mr. Hendrix subsequently received a Notice of Determination (\\u201cNOD\\u201d) dated October 3, 2011, from the Chief of the SCD stating that a determination was made to revoke Mr. Hendrix\\u2019s Top Secret security clearance based on his knowing use of the Baltimore FO\\u2019s Confidential Fund for unauthorized purposes associated with a retirement party, and for intimidating a subordinate employee to sign Secret Service forms authorizing the payment. (Compl. \\u00b6 44; Mot. 2 \\u00b6 8; Opp\\u2019n 11). Between October 1, 2010 and October 3, 2011, the SCD placed Mr. Hendrix on \\u201cDo Not Admit\\u201d status, which meant that he was not permitted access to secure facilities or grounds. (Compl. \\u00b6\\u00b6 43, 46; Mot. 2 \\u00b6\\u00b6 6, 7; Opp\\u2019n 10). Mr. Hendrix appealed the NOD to the final stage of review for such actions and 2 In the Complaint, Mr. Hendrix alleges he retired \\u201con or around September 31, 2012.\\u201d (Compl. \\u00b6 15). The Court takes judicial notice that September has only 30 days, and therefore construes the intended date as September 30th. 2 received a notice dated July 20, 2012, upholding the revocation of his Top Secret security clearance and informing him that there was no further right to appeal. (Mot. 3 \\u00b6\\u00b6 9, 10; Opp\\u2019n 11). On November 9, 2011, Mr. Hendrix received a notice of Proposed Indefinite Suspension from the Los Angeles FO informing Mr. Hendrix of a proposal to suspend him for an indefinite period without pay for failure to maintain his Top Secret security clearance; the notice provided appeal rights to the parent office for the Los Angeles FO. (Compl. \\u00b6 7; Mot. 3 \\u00b6 11; Opp\\u2019n 11). Following Mr. Hendrix\\u2019s response to the proposal, on January 12, 2012, he received an Indefinite Suspension Decision from the parent office for the Los Angeles FO stating that he would be suspended from duty without pay for an indefinite period of time effective January 14, 2012. This Decision further stated that the indefinite suspension would terminate at such time as the Secret Service issued either a decision reinstating Mr. Hendrix\\u2019s Top Secret security clearance, or issued a final decision revoking that clearance and completed any further adverse action stemming from the same matter. (Compl. \\u00b6 50; Mot. 4 \\u00b6 12 and Ex. 11; Opp\\u2019n 11). Mr. Hendrix then received a notice of Proposed Removal dated July 30, 2012 from Special Agent in Charge (\\u201cSAIC\\u201d) Joseph Beaty that proposed Mr. Hendrix\\u2019s removal from Secret Service employment based on failure to meet the requirements of his position due to revocation of his Top Secret security clearance. (Compl. \\u00b6 51; Mot. 4 \\u00b6 13; Opp\\u2019n 12). The Proposed Removal required that any reply be directed to Deputy Assistant Director (\\u201cDAD\\u201d) Lee Fields, Office of Investigations. (Id.). Mr. Hendrix submitted a written reply and subsequently received a Removal Decision from DAD Fields upholding the proposed removal 3 and making Mr. Hendrix\\u2019s removal effective October 1, 2012. (Mot. 4 \\u00b6 14; Opp\\u2019n 12). Mr. Hendrix retired effective September 30, 2012. 3 (Compl. \\u00b6 15; Mot. 5 \\u00b6 15; Opp\\u2019n 9). II. LEGAL STANDARD Summary judgment is proper \\u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). \\u201cThe plain language of Rule 56(c) mandates the entry of summary judgment, after adequate time for discovery and upon motion, against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that partys case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.\\u201d Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986). \\u201cIn such a situation, there can be \\u2018no genuine issue as to any material fact,\\u2019 since a complete failure of proof concerning an essential element of the nonmoving party\\u2019s case necessarily renders all other facts immaterial.\\u201d Maydak v. United States, 630 F.3d 166, 181 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (quoting Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 322-23). \\u201cThe moving party is \\u2018entitled to a judgment as a matter of law\\u2019 because the nonmoving party has failed to make a sufficient showing on an essential element of her case with respect to which she has the burden of proof.\\u201d Id. (quoting Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 323). \\u201cThe standard for granting summary judgment mirrors the standard for a directed verdict under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(a), which is that the trial judge must direct a verdict if, under the governing law, there can be but one reasonable conclusion as to the verdict.\\u201d Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 250 (1986). \\u201cRegardless of whether the moving party accompanies its summary judgment motion with affidavits, the motion may, and should, be granted so long as whatever is before the district court demonstrates that the standard for the 3 See supra, n.2. 4 entry of summary judgment, as set forth in Rule 56(c), is satisfied. One of the principal purposes of the summary judgment rule is to isolate and dispose of factually unsupported claims or defenses.\\u201d Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 323-24. III. ANALYSIS a. Count IV: Constructive Discharge In Count IV of his Complaint, Mr. Hendrix alleges that his retirement from the Secret Service the day before his removal was to be effective was involuntary and amounted to a constructive discharge due to the Secretary\\u2019s unlawful conduct; namely, racial discrimination, retaliation, hostile work environment, and compulsion or duress. (Compl. \\u00b6\\u00b6 108\\u201310). Mr. Hendrix alleges numerous injuries as a direct and proximate result of the alleged constructive discharge, including but not limited to, lost wages, loss of reputation, promotion, and career prospects, and medical expenses and costs. (Id. \\u00b6\\u00b6 111\\u201313). As noted above, however, Mr. Hendrix has voluntarily withdrawn his three Title VII Counts, which consist of racial discrimination, hostile work environment, and retaliation. \\u201cA finding of constructive discharge depends on whether the employer deliberately made working conditions intolerable and drove the employee into an involuntary quit.\\u201d Clark v. Marsh, 665 F.2d 1168, 1173 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (internal quotations omitted) (citing Retail Store Employees Union Local 880 v. NLRB, 419 F.2d 329, 332 (D.C. Cir. 1968)). \\u201cThe inquiry is objective: Did working conditions become so intolerable that a reasonable person in the employee\\u2019s position would have felt compelled to resign?\\u201d Penn. State Police v. Suders, 542 U.S. 129, 130 (2004). When Clark was decided, the D.C. Circuit \\u201chad not previously addressed the constructive discharge issue in a Title VII context,\\u201d Clark, 665 F.2d at 1173; that 5 is, where a plaintiff alleged that Title VII discrimination drove the employee into an involuntary quit. i. Constructive Discharge and Title VII Discrimination In Clark, the D.C. Circuit examined case law from other Circuits and found the Fifth Circuit\\u2019s policy discussion helpful. \\u201cSociety and the policies underlying Title VII will be best served if, wherever possible, unlawful discrimination is attacked within the context of existing employment relationships.\\u201d Clark, 665 F.2d at 1174 (quoting Bourque v. Powell Elec. Mfg. Co., 617 F.2d 61, 66 (5th Cir. 1980)). Therefore, a Title VII plaintiff must \\u201cmitigate damages by remaining on the job\\u201d unless that job presents \\u201csuch an aggravated situation that a reasonable employee would be forced to resign.\\u201d Id. (quoting Bourque, 617 F.2d at 66). For example, the Fifth Circuit in Bourque found that a Title VII constructive discharge claim could not be sustained simply upon discrimination manifested in the form of unequal pay; rather, such discrimination required an \\u201caggravated situation\\u201d to give rise to a constrictive discharge. Id. Under the facts of Bourque, the Fifth Circuit observed: \\u201cWhile we by no means discount the discrimination Ms. Bourque may have faced, we simply do not believe that working for unequal pay under the circumstances presented here constitutes a condition of employment so intolerable that an employee is forced into involuntary resignation. The very fact that Ms. Bourque accepted the position under the conditions imposed belies such a contention.\\u201d Id. at 65. After reviewing cases from the Fifth, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits, including Bourque, the D.C. Circuit held in Clark that a constructive discharge of a Title VII plaintiff must be justified by the existence of \\u201caggravating factors\\u201d beyond the Title VII discrimination itself. Clark, 665 F.2d at 1174. 4 In order to prevail on a claim of constructive discharge in this Circuit, therefore, a 4 In Clark v. Marsh, the D.C. Circuit found the following circumstances amounted to \\u201caggravating factors\\u201d sufficient to result in constructive discharge: Ms. Clark, the former Acting Director of Office of Employment Policy 6 Title VII plaintiff must show \\u201cthat (1) intentional discrimination existed, (2) the employer deliberately made working conditions intolerable, and (3) aggravating factors justified the plaintiffs conclusion that she had no option but to end her employment.\\u201d Carter v. George Wash. Univ., 180 F. Supp. 97, 111 (D.D.C. 2001) (citing Clark, 665 F.2d at 1173-74). \\u201c\\u2018Aggravating factors\\u2019 are those aspects of a discriminatory work environment that, by making the workplace so disagreeable, prevent the reasonable employee from seeking remediation on the job.\\u201d Veitch v. England, 471 F.3d 124, 130 (D.C. Cir. 2006); see also Clark, 665 F.2d at 1174. Here, Plaintiff has withdrawn all of his Title VII claims. Where a plaintiff alleges that he or she was constructively discharged under Title VII and he or she fails to state a Title VII claim, the constructive discharge claim also necessarily fails to state a claim as a matter of law. Cole v. Powell, 605 F. Supp. 2d 20, 25\\u201326 (D.D.C. 2009). Therefore, to the extent Mr. Hendrix\\u2019s constructive discharge claim relies upon Title VII discrimination, the constructive discharge claims fails as a matter of law. The Court now turns to Mr. Hendrix\\u2019s claim that he was constructively discharged due to compulsion or duress. ii. Constructive Discharge and Compulsion or Duress An employee\\u2019s resignation or retirement is presumed to be voluntary and not an adverse action, unless the employee overcomes the presumption by showing that the resignation or retirement was involuntary, and therefore qualifies as a constructive discharge. Aliotta v. Bair, 614 F.3d 556, 566\\u201367 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (citing Veitch, 471 F.3d at 134 (Rogers, J., concurring)). \\u201cFor a resignation to be rendered involuntary on account of duress, three criteria must be met: and Grievance Review of Army, had obtained only one permanent promotion in an 11-year period in which she sought advancement despite an outstanding employment record, formal administrative charges had failed to produce corrective action, a law school graduate selected to be Director had no supervisory experience, the former Acting Director had historically been subject to discrimination, Ms. Clark had repeatedly but unsuccessfully attempted to obtain relief from discrimination, and predictable humiliation and loss of prestige would accompany her failure to obtain the position of Director. Clark, 665 F.2d at 1174. 7 \\u20181 an agency imposes the terms of an employees resignation, 2 the employees circumstances permit no alternative but to accept, and 3 those circumstances were the result of improper acts of the agency.\\u2019\\u201d Keyes v. Dist. of Columbia, 372 F.3d 434, 439 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (emphasis added) (quoting Schultz v. U.S. Navy, 810 F.2d 1133, 1136 (Fed. Cir. 1987)). \\u201cWhere an employee is faced merely with the unpleasant alternatives of resigning or being subject to removal for cause, such limited choices do not make the resulting resignation an involuntary act.\\u201d Keyes, 372 F.3d at 439 (quoting Schultz, 810 F.2d at 1136); see also Hill v. Gray, No. 13- 0001, 2014 WL 1118005, at *9 (D.D.C. Mar. 21, 2014) (\\u201cAn employee\\u2019s resignation or retirement, when the only other available option for the employee is removal by the employer for valid reasons, does not qualify as constructive discharge.\\u201d) (emphasis in original) (citing Keyes, 372 F.3d at 439\\u201340). \\u201cMere uncertainty due to the threat of a RIF reduction in force layoff does not translate into a constructive discharge.\\u201d Aliotta, 614 F.3d at 567 (distinguishing between an employee being faced with the risk of termination and the absolute certainty of termination). It is undisputed that Mr. Hendrix\\u2019s Top Secret security clearance was suspended pending an investigation into adverse information concerning his conduct. It is further undisputed that the Secret Service subsequently decided to revoke Mr. Hendrix\\u2019s Top Secret security clearance. Mr. Hendrix acknowledges that, absent a statute providing otherwise, a court may not review a decision regarding suspension or revocation of a Top Secret Security clearance, because such decisions are nonjusticiable under Egan. Consistent with Egan, Mr. Hendrix makes clear that he \\u201cis not challenging the denial, revocation or investigation of his security clearance.\\u201d (Opp\\u2019n 20). Thus, the parties concede, and the law mandates, that this Court cannot question the reasons for the revocation of Mr. Hendrix\\u2019s Top Secret security clearance, at least in this instance where Mr. 8 Hendrix has not pleaded a constitutional challenge to revocation. Cf. Oryszak v. Sullivan, 388 F.3d 522, 526 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (\\u201cTherefore, following the lead of the Supreme Court, we have consistently held that because the authority to issue a security clearance is a discretionary function of the Executive Branch, actions based upon denial of security clearance are committed to agency discretion by law, at least where a constitutional claim is not properly presented.\\u201d) (citations omitted). The parties also do not dispute that Mr. Hendrix received a notice of proposed removal from his employment with the Secret Service for failure to maintain a Top Secret security clearance, and that maintaining such a clearance was a requirement for Secret Service employment. It is further undisputed that following Mr. Hendrix\\u2019s response to the removal proposal, DAD Fields issued a Removal Decision upholding the proposed removal and providing that Mr. Hendrix\\u2019s removal would be effective on October 1, 2012. Mr. Hendrix therefore concedes that he had no option to continue his employment since he faced imminent removal for revocation of his Top Secret clearance. The parties also agree that Mr. Hendrix retired effective September 30, 2012. Mr. Hendrix has not properly presented any constitutional challenge to the revocation of his security clearance. Therefore, this Court cannot question the propriety of the revocation of Mr. Hendrix\\u2019s Top Secret security clearance, which the parties agree was essential for his continued Secret Service employment. Although Mr. Hendrix alleges that he \\u201cwas compelled to retire\\u201d (Opp\\u2019n Ex. 2, Aff. of Mr. Hendrix), he was faced with the same situation as in Keyes\\u2014 that is, Mr. Hendrix was \\u201cfaced merely with the unpleasant alternatives of resigning or being subject to removal for cause, and such limited choices do not make the resulting resignation an involuntary act.\\u201d 372 F.3d at 439. Under the undisputed facts and the controlling law, because 9 Mr. Hendrix faced certain removal for cause and instead chose to retire, he cannot establish that his retirement was involuntary and therefore cannot establish an essential element of constructive discharge due to duress. 5 iii. Constructive Discharge and Summary Judgment Mr. Hendrix argues that summary judgment is premature and urges the Court to not convert the Motion to one for summary judgment, and instead to permit him to take discovery, without which \\u201cPlaintiff will be deprived of a reasonable opportunity to gain evidence to support his case.\\u201d (Opp\\u2019n 18). However, the law of this Circuit and the undisputed facts preclude Mr. Hendrix from establishing an essential element of his constructive discharge claim\\u2014that his retirement was involuntary. No additional facts that Mr. Hendrix could uncover during discovery would alter this reality. See Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 322-23 (\\u201cA complete failure of proof concerning an essential element of the nonmoving party\\u2019s case necessarily renders all other facts immaterial.\\u201d). The Secretary expressly moved for summary judgment on Mr. Hendrix\\u2019s Count IV constructive discharge claim. The Court is not presented with a Rule 12(d) situation where it must determine whether to convert a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim to one for summary judgment. Indeed, Mr. Hendrix specifically responded to all of the Secretary\\u2019s statements of undisputed material fact by admitting and denying them as Mr. Hendrix deemed appropriate, and submitted two exhibits in support of his Opposition\\u2014an Individual Complaint of Employment Discrimination, dated December 18, 2012 (ECF No. 13-1, Ex. 1), and his own affidavit (ECF No. 13-2, Ex. 2). Despite Mr. Hendrix\\u2019s urging now that the Court not \\u201cconvert\\u201d 5 As previously explained, the Court also finds that Mr. Hendrix cannot establish constructive discharge due to Title VII discrimination. 10 the Secretary\\u2019s Motion to one for summary judgment, Mr. Hendrix responded to it as if it was a summary judgment motion. Mr. Hendrix cites Federal Rule 56(d) in his Opposition, but has not made a proper Rule 56(d) request. The Rule states that \\u201cif a nonmovant shows by affidavit or declaration that, for specified reasons, it cannot present facts essential to justify its opposition, the court may: (1) defer considering the motion or deny it; (2) allow time to obtain affidavits or declarations or to take discovery; or (3) issue any other appropriate relief.\\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(d). 6 Mr. Hendrix did not offer such an affidavit or declaration, nor did he identify any particular facts he intends to discover or explain how discovery could avoid summary judgment. Although the only remaining claim in his suit is constructive discharge by compulsion or duress, Mr. Hendrix inexplicably claims he needs discovery because \\u201cthe vast majority of the documents needed to support plaintiff\\u2019s discrimination case is in the sole possession of the employer.\\u201d (Opp\\u2019n at 18). Moreover, he does not identify what documents he seeks from the Secretary other than to refer to them as \\u201ccomparator information.\\u201d (Id. at 19). Mr. Hendrix has not explained what bearing, if any, \\u201ccomparator information\\u201d has on the elements of non-Title VII constructive 6 To obtain Rule 56(f) relief now found at Rule 56(d), the movant must submit an affidavit which \\u201cstates with sufficient particularity . . . why additional discovery is necessary.\\u201d Ikossi v. Dept. of Navy, 516 F.3d 1037, 1045 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (internal quotation marks, citation omitted). The affidavit must satisfy three criteria. First, it must outline the particular facts he intends to discover and describe why those facts are necessary to the litigation. Byrd v. U.S. Envtl. Prot. Agency, 174 F.3d 239, 248 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (\\u201cByrd must show what facts he intended to discover that would create a triable issue . . . .\\u201d). Second, it must explain \\u201cwhy he could not produce the facts in opposition to the motion for summary judgment.\\u201d Carpenter v. Fed. Natl Mortg. Ass\\u2019n, 174 F.3d 231, 237 (D.C. Cir. 1999) . . . . Third, it must show the information is in fact discoverable. Messina v. Krakower, 439 F.3d 755, 762 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (\\u201cWe will not find an abuse of discretion where the requesting party has offered only a conclusory assertion without any supporting facts to justify the proposition that the discovery sought will produce the evidence required.\\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Convertino v. U.S. Dep\\u2019t of Justice, 684 F.3d 93, 99-100 (D.C. Cir. 2012). 11 discharge. Lastly, he has not shown that any purported documentation he seeks is discoverable. Mr. Hendrix has therefore failed to make a proper Rule 56(d) request. In addition to requesting discovery, Mr. Hendrix also asserts \\u201ca right to confront, cross- examine and impeach adverse witnesses, like Robert Merletti, Robin Despropero-Philpot, Carolyn McMillon and his supervisors, through depositions.\\u201d (Id.). Putting aside whether he indeed has a \\u201cright\\u201d to do so in response to a summary judgment motion, Mr. Hendrix does not explain how doing so could defeat summary judgment. For this Court to deny Defendant\\u2019s Motion given the undisputed facts, it would have to be possible that retirement in lieu of imminent termination for cause\\u2014absent a constitutional challenge\\u2014could amount to constructive discharge. This is not the law in this Circuit. The undisputed material facts, under Keyes, preclude Mr. Hendrix from establishing an essential element of his constructive discharge by duress claim\\u2014that his retirement was involuntary\\u2014and under Egan and its , preclude the Court from finding that his termination was for any reason other than cause. b. Count V of the Complaint: Equitable Relief Mr. Hendrix asserts a claim for equitable relief in Count V. Equitable relief, however, is a form of relief and not a cause of action. 7 Since the Court grants the motion for summary judgment as to Count IV, there is no cause of action in this matter upon which it could grant any equitable relief. The Court, therefore, dismisses Count V for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. 7 See, e.g., Davis v. Passman, 442 U.S. 228, 239-40 n.18 (1979) (\\u201ccause of action is a question of whether a particular plaintiff is a member of the class of litigants that may, as a matter of law, appropriately invoke the power of the court; and relief is a question of the various remedies a federal court may make available.\\u201d) (emphases in original). 12 IV. CONCLUSION The Court grants the Secretary\\u2019s motion to dismiss and for summary judgment because Mr. Hendrix cannot make a sufficient showing on an essential element of his Count IV claim, Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 322, and because his remaining Count V fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.

            "MEMORANDUM OF DECISION AND ORDER SPATT, District Judge. On August 25, 2011, the Plaintiff Marie Placide-Eugene (the “Plaintiff’) filed a claim of discrimination with the New York State Division of Human Rights (the “NYSDHR”), alleging that her former employer, the Defendant Visiting Nurse Service of New York (“VNSNY”) had subjected her to discrimination due to her national origin. On March 7, 2012, the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission issued to the Plaintiff a right to sue letter. On June 4, 2012, the Plaintiff commenced this action against VNSNY and certain former supervisors, Eloise Goldberg (“Goldberg”), Jill Mendelson (“Mendelson”) and Marian Haas (“Haas”) pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq. (“Title VH”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981 and 1983, and the New York State Human Rights Law, New York State Executive Law § 290 et seq. (the “NYSHRL”). The Plaintiff asserts that the Defendants unlawfully discriminated, harassed, and retaliated against her (1) based on her race/color and national origin and (2) due to her complaints of discrimination. On November 8, 2012, the Defendants moved to partially dismiss the complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (“Fed R. Civ. P.”) 12(b)(6). The Defendant challenged the portion of the Plaintiffs Title VII claim that alleged discrimination, retaliation, and hostile work environment based on national origin. On December 7, 2012, the Plaintiff confirmed that she was withdrawing her NYSHRL and §§ 1981 and 1983 claims against the Individual Defendants. At that point, the VNSNY .became the only remaining Defendant. In addition, the only claim remaining in this action was the Plaintiffs Title VII claim for discrimination and retaliation, as it was brought against the VNSNY alone. On May 30, 2013, the Court denied the Defendant’s motion to dismiss the Title VII claim alleging discrimination and retaliation based on national origin. On June 4, 2013, the Plaintiff filed an amended complaint consistent with the May 30, 2013 order. Following the completion of discovery, on May 22, 2014, VNSNY moved pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 56 for summary judgment dismissing the amended complaint. For the following reasons, VNSNY’s motion for summary judgment is granted. I. BACKGROUND Unless otherwise stated, the following facts are drawn from the parties’ Rule 56.1 Statements and exhibits and construed in a light most favorable to the non-moving party, the Plaintiff. Triable issues of fact are noted. A. The Parties The Plaintiffs color is black, her race is black, and her national origin is Haitan. VNSNY is a not-for-profit organization that provides a range of home and community-based health care services. B. The Plaintiff’s Hiring In 2001, VSNSNY hired the Plaintiff as a Registered Nurse. The Plaintiffs job responsibilities included coordinating and providing multidisciplinary home-based healthcare services to patients residing Massapequa, Long Island and her sched*136uled work hours were Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. During her employment with VNSNY, the Plaintiff was a member of a bargaining unit represented by the United Federation of Teachers, Local 2 (the “Union”). At all relevant times, VNSNY and the Union were parties to a collective bargaining agreement (“CBA”). When a VNSNY nurse visits a patient’s home, the nurse is required to call San-trax, a call-in system that keeps track of a nurse’s time and attendance, using the patient’s telephone, and the nurse enters a unique code specific to the patient in order to document the nurse’s arrival at the patient’s home. During her employment with VNSNY, the Plaintiff never found herself in a situation where the patient lacked a working telephone that she could use to call Santrax. On October 11, 2011, Mendelson sent an email to several nurses in which she congratulated the Plaintiff for achieving the highest score for placing timely calls into the Santrax call-in system in September 2011. VNSNY issued a tablet computer to the Plaintiff to use when providing care during patient visits. A VNSNY nurse uses her VNSNY-issued tablet computer to document a patient’s signature, to document that the patient was unable to sign, or to document that the patient forgot to sign. C. Leave Time When a VNSNY nurse wishes to schedule a vacation, the nurse is required to submit a vacation request to a VNSNY computer system called Work Brain. Vacation time for VNSNY nurses is scheduled based on seniority and the percentage of staff that is permitted to be absent at any given time, which is 10%. The Plaintiff submitted a request in calendar year 2010 for vacation time from August 23, 2010 to September 7, 2010. After her vacation request was denied, the Plaintiff submitted a new request for time off from August 30 to September 7, 2010, which was approved. Although the Plaintiffs request to use vacation time on August 26, 2010 and August 27, 2010 was denied, Mendelson and Goldberg scheduled her to work the weekend of August 21 and 22, 2010, so that she could be scheduled off on August 26 and 27, 2010. However, the Plaintiff contends that her vacation requests were routinely denied. The Plaintiff concedes that she was never disciplined during her employment with VNSNY for excessive use of sick time, for using sick time to extend a vacation or a weekend, or for abusing sick time or medical leave D. Bereavement Time Pursuant to the CBA, bargaining unit members are entitled to three paid workdays for leave for death in family in the case of the death of a spouse, child, mother, father, sister, brother, grandparent, mother-in-law, father-in-law, sister-in-law, brother-in-law, or other individual who lives in the same household as the employee. Such leave must be taken at the time of the funeral. Also, the CBA does not provide for leave for death in the family for a grandmother-in-law. The CBA also provides that “the Employer shall have the right, at its sole discretion, to require any employee to work on any of the holidays herein specified New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King Jr.’s Birthday, President’s Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day. The Employer will, consistent with the needs of the Employer, distribute holidays on an equitable basis.” (Goldberg Affid., Exh. A.) Finally, of relevance here, under the CBA, “the Employer will assign holiday work on an equitable basis subject to operation*137al requirements ... Any Employee who has worked for the Employer for over fifteen (15) years will not be required to work holidays unless required for the effective and efficient operation of the Employer or Region / Program.” (Id.) The Plaintiffs husband’s grandmother died in 2009, and in connection therewith, she requested bereavement leave. However, the Plaintiffs sister-in-law, Marie As- tride-Eugene, also an employee of VNSNY, requested a different weekend off to attend the funeral. In November 2009, Mendelson informed the Plaintiff that her request for bereavement leave was not granted because the time was not authorized under the CBA. E.The December 30, 2010 Complaint On December 30, 2010, a patient’s wife (“the December 30, 2010 complainant”) complained that the Plaintiff visited her home to see her husband; that the Plaintiff was coughing heavily; and that the Plaintiff was sick at the time of the visit. The December 30, 2010 complainant stated her belief that the Plaintiff placed her husband at risk of contracting her illness. The Plaintiff claims that, on this occasion, she was required to report to work despite advising VNSNY officials that she was ill. The parties dispute whether the Plaintiff and Mendelson discussed this incident thereafter. The Plaintiff was not disciplined in connection with this complaint. In the coordinator of care note she had prepared relating to the encounter described by the December 30, 2010 complainant, the Plaintiff wrote: “The case is not opened; vn reported to pt’s residence to open the case even though vn was not feeling well; pt’s wife noted that vn was coughing incessantly; she requested for vn to stop providing the care to her husband; she stated that her husband is undergoing chemotherapy, has a weakened immune system and prone to infection; vn concurred and notified psm Jill.” (Mendelson Aff. At ¶ 30, Exh. M) F. The May 18, 2011 Complaint On May 18, 2011, the wife of a VNSNY patient (“May 18, 2011 complainant”) contacted Mendelson to file a complaint about the Plaintiff. The May 18, 2011 complainant told Mendelson that the Plaintiff never took off her jacket during the visit and that the Plaintiff was at the house for 30-45 minutes or less. G. The May 20, 2011 Complaint During the afternoon of May 20, 2011, Mendelson received a telephone call from the daughter of one of the Plaintiffs assigned patients for that day (the “May 20, 2011 complainant”) for the purpose of submitting a complaint about the Plaintiff. The May 20, 2011 complainant stated that the Plaintiff left her a telephone message the night before, stating that she would visit the patient between 11:00 a.m. and 12:00 p.m. the next day. The May 20, 2011 complainant allegedly told Mendelson that on May 20, 2011, the Plaintiff arrived at the patient’s home at 1:00 p.m., when the patient was no longer home. The Plaintiff maintains that she arrived at the patient’s home at 10:30 a.m., at which time she was advised that the patient had forgotten that she would be visiting and was not home at the time. H. The May 20, 201T Catheter Patient Incident On May 20, 2011, one hour before the end of the Plaintiffs scheduled work hours, her supervisor, Mendelson, telephoned the Plaintiff and directed her to visit a patient in Massapequa to address the patient’s leaking foley catheter. *138The Plaintiff told Mendelson that she was almost home in Suffolk County and near the Smith Haven Mall. The Plaintiff adds that, prior to this call, at about 2:30 p.m., the Plaintiff called Mendelson and advised her that she was finished with her visits for the day and was, as per normal company practice, heading home to complete her reports and paperwork relating to her daily visits.. The Plaintiff told Men-delson during the 3:30 p.m. telephone conversation that, due to traffic, it would take her two hours to reach the catheter patient and that the visit would be after her regular work hours. The Plaintiff queried Mendelson as to whether she would be paid extra compensation for this visit. The Plaintiff stated at her deposition that the home health aide for the patient told her that a white nurse, Justin Horri-gan, had previously declined to deal with the issue, yet he was not disciplined. Following this conversation, Mendelson spoke with Denise Massaro (“Massaro”), VNSNY Clinical Director of Nassau County and Mendelson’s own supervisor, about the Plaintiffs response to Mendelson’s direction that the Plaintiff visit the catheter patient. Massaro called the Plaintiff to verify that she would visit the patient, and at or about 6:00 p.m. on May 20, 2011, the Plaintiff arrived at the home of the patient. I. VNSNY Begins its Investigation Massaro, Mendelson, and Goldberg subsequently began an investigation of the Plaintiffs patient visits on May 20, 2011. As part of their investigation, Mendelson, Goldberg, and Massaro obtained and reviewed a Service Charge Processing report concerning the Plaintiff from VNSNY’s Information Systems Department from May 19, 2011 and May 20, 2011. The report indicated the number of patients the Plaintiff visited; whether she visited those patients in the morning or afternoon hours; and the duration of the visits as recorded by the Plaintiff. According to the Plaintiffs Service Charge Processing report for May 20, 2011, she recorded that she had visited six patients on May 20, 2011, and had visited all of her patients during afternoon hours. Further, although the Plaintiff had left Massapequa before 3:30 p.m., according to the Service Charge Processing report for May 20, 2011, for four of her patients, she provided care for a period of one hour each; for another patient, care lasted two hours; and for the remaining patient, her care lasted twenty minutes. In addition, Massaro, Goldberg, and Mendelson obtained and reviewed the Plaintiffs clinical notes for the patient who required the replacement of a foley catheter on May 20, 2011. In the Plaintiffs clinical note, she recorded: “VN rec’d call from PSM at 3:38 pm who demanded for VN to go to pt’s home after working hrs to change the pt’s foley cath that was leaking; PSM threatened to deduct lhr from VN’s paycheck if VN does not carry out the assignment; she stated that she will notify Denise about the above.” (Mendelson Aff. Exh. D.) The Defendants deny that Men-delson threatened to deduct any time from the Plaintiffs paycheck if she failed to carry out the May 20, 2011 assignment on the catheter patient. The Plaintiff also recorded in the medical records that “during the visit pt’s daughter stated she informed the office around noon time that pt’s foley was leaking; vn rec’d call from psm jill at 3:30 pm and she demanded for vn to go to pt’s home to change the foley cath; vn informed psm that it will take vn 2 hrs to carry out the assignment and that would extend into after working hrs; vn called psm at 5:05 pm to notify her that vn was sitting in traffic; vn arrived at pt’s home at 6:09; the existing foley was removed *139and the new foley reinserted with return of 50 cc of clear urine; pt tolerated tx well.” (Id.). J. The May 23, 2011 Meeting On May 23, 2011, the Plaintiff attended a meeting with Goldberg, Mendelson, Mas-saro, and Marie Desil, a union representative (“Desil”). The Defendant states that, at this meeting, Goldberg directed the Plaintiff to explain where she was at the beginning of her work day on May 20, 2011. The Defendant further states that Goldberg, Mendelson, and Massaro showed the Plaintiff the Service Charge Processing report and discussed comments the Plaintiff made in the catheter patient’s medical record. Finally, the Defendants maintain that the Plaintiff was told that she was suspended pending further investigation. The Plaintiff states that this meeting lasted only a few minutes and that she was accused of fraud. Later that day, Massaro had a telephone conversation with Cris Ruiz, Employee Relations Manager (“Ruiz”) about the Plaintiffs patient visits on May 20, 2011 and the documentation Massaro reviewed. K. The Subsequent Investigation On May 26, 2011, Goldberg, Mendelson, and Massaro had a telephone conversation with Ruiz to discuss the meeting on May 23, 2011 and the results of VNSNY’s investigation during the week of May 23, 2011. During this conference, Goldberg, Mendel-son, and Massaro allegedly told Ruiz that during the May 23, 2011 meeting, the Plaintiff stated that she visited her first patient at 9:30 a.m. on May 23, 2011. However, this assertion by the Plaintiff contradicted the Plaintiffs visit signature reports from May 2011 from VNSNY’s Information Systems Department. The visit signature reports identify the times when each patient signed the Plaintiffs tablet to verify the occurrence of the visit. The visit signature report from May 20, 2011 showed that the Plaintiff obtained her first patient’s signature at 12:50 p.m. The Plaintiff maintains that her first visit was scheduled for 10:30 a.m., but as the patient was not home, the Plaintiff did not meet with the patient, call into Santrax, or obtain the patient’s signature. As part of her investigation, Goldberg obtained visit signature reports for 15 nurses working in Nassau County, selected at random, from VNSNY’s Information Systems Department. The visit signature reports for the fifteen randomly selected nurses in Nassau County showed longer average times between patient visits than the Plaintiffs visit signature reports showed, and they showed patient signatures in both the mornings and afternoons on each day. Goldberg observed in the course of her investigation that the Plaintiff visited her patients either all in the morning or all in the afternoon, whereas other VNSNY nurses visited their patients during the morning and afternoon. The visit signature reports obtained for the Plaintiff in May 2011 showed that there were instances in which there was less than ten minutes between patient signatures. In this regard, Goldberg believed that the visit signature reports obtained for the Plaintiff in May 2011 showed that the Plaintiffs patient visits were abbreviated because, for example, three successive patient signatures were obtained within less than 30 minutes, so that the amount of time spent with the middle patient was unlikely to be adequate. The Plaintiff maintains that she treated patients in the same geographic area, and sometimes on the same block and could have had someone sign at the end of her visit and then another sign right away at *140the beginning and that would not be cause for concern or a problem. L. The Plaintiffs Suspension On May 27, 2011, the Plaintiff attended a meeting in Goldberg’s office with Men-delson, Goldberg, Massaro, and Jacqueline Vaughan Roberts (“Roberts”), a union representative. During this meeting, Goldberg informed the Plaintiff that the reports Mendelson, Massaro, and Goldberg obtained and reviewed demonstrated that the Plaintiff had conducted abbreviated visits to patients and that the Plaintiffs oral account of events on May 20, 2011 during the May 23, 2011 meeting was not consistent with the reports. The Plaintiff claims that she never provided an account of events at the May 23, 2011 meeting. The Defendants further contend that the Plaintiff did not give any explanation for the discrepancies Goldberg identified or for her abbreviated patient visits. The Plaintiff counters that she was never provided an opportunity to do so. At the end of the May 27, 2011 meeting, Goldberg told the Plaintiff that she was suspended from employment pending further investigation. Goldberg instructed the Plaintiff to return her tablet and cell phone to VNSNY. A discipline form was provided to Jacqueline Roberts, the Plaintiffs union representative, who then faxed the form to Plaintiff. During the Plaintiffs suspension, Goldberg, Massaro, and Mendelson obtained and reviewed visit signature reports from VNSNY’s Information Systems Department for the Plaintiff for the months of April and May 2010 to determine whether the Plaintiffs pattern of concentrating patient visits in part of the work day predated the prior period of investigation. Goldberg, Massaro, and Mendelson ultimately concluded that the Plaintiffs visit signature reports from April and May 2010 revealed similar abbreviated workdays and patient visits that typically lasted less than thirty minutes. According to the Plaintiff, her annual performance evaluations and monthly productivity reports never indicated any issues with her performance, and she always provided the adequate amount of time for a patient to provide proper care. On June 3, 2011, the Plaintiff, through her attorneys, sent a letter to VNSNY alleging that she was being subjected to discrimination in the course of her employment at VNSNY. M. The Plaintiffs Suspension is Lifted On July 22, 2011, Goldberg mailed a letter to the Plaintiff directing the Plaintiff to contact Goldberg to schedule a meeting to discuss the results of VNSNY’s investigation and the outcome of the Plaintiffs suspension from employment. On August 3, 2011, the Plaintiff met with Mendelson, Massaro, Goldberg, and Roberts. At this meeting, Goldberg described the visit signature reports that she reviewed during the Plaintiffs suspension. The Plaintiff received a revised discipline form which stated that the Plaintiff had been suspended from employment and she was being placed on a Performance Improvement Plan (“PIP”). Pursuant to the PIP, the Plaintiff was required to: report to the Nassau office at 8:30 a.m. each work day; review her workday with her manager prior to leaving the office; telephone her manager each day when her field visits were concluded; review her daily schedule with her manager prior to leaving the office; meet with her manager two times per week to review work to ensure appropriate care; increase observed field visits with the orientation nurse; follow up with select patients; and meet with the orientation *141nurse regarding documentation of visit times. Goldberg told the Plaintiff that her suspension had been lifted. The Defendants assert that the Plaintiff requested time to consider the discipline and the PIP before she decided whether to return to work. The Plaintiff states that she only asked that she be permitted to fax a copy of the discipline form to her attorney. Regardless, on August 9, 2011, Goldberg mailed a letter to the Plaintiff, in which Goldberg directed the Plaintiff to advise her by August 12, 2011 whether she intended to return to work. In that letter, Goldberg confirmed that the Plaintiff had previously scheduled approved vacation time for the week of August 15, 2011 which Goldberg would honor if the Plaintiff decided to return to work. On August 17, 2011, Goldberg mailed a letter to the Plaintiff in which Goldberg directed her to report to work on August 22, 2011, and that if she did not report to work on that date, she would be deemed to have resigned from employment with VNSNY. On August 22, 2011, the Plaintiff returned to work. On September 7, 2011, Mendelson met with the Plaintiff to discuss the objectives of the PIP.\" Mendelson explained to the Plaintiff that the PIP was a learning experience to enable her to perform her job better and to ensure adherence to standards of care and documentation; that the PIP was not punitive; that Mendelson believed that the Plaintiff had the ability and intelligence to improve; that the Plaintiff demonstrated better compliance and provision of teaching guides, that a patient had complimented her care; and gave the Plaintiff positive feedback on noticing the weight gain of a patient with congestive heart failure. The Plaintiff does not recall any such meeting. N. The August 29, 2011 Complainant On August 29, 2011, a patient’s daughter (the “August 29, 2011 complainant”) complained to Mendelson that on August 25, 2011, the Plaintiff told her that she should give her father (the patient) “the increased dose of Lasix 40mg prescribed by his cardiologist at St. Francis Hospital.” (Men-delson Affid., at ¶ 23.) The August 29, 2011 complainant stated to Mendelson that her father was not currently on Lasix and did not have a cardiologist at St. Francis Hospital. The August 29, 2011 complainant stated to Mendelson that she disputed the point with the Plaintiff several times but that the Plaintiff persisted in repeating the instructions. The Plaintiff concedes that, on this occasion, she had called the wrong patient but, upon learning this error, immediately apologized and ended the phone call. The August 29, 2011 complainant allegedly told Mendelson that she lacked confidence in the Plaintiffs ability to provide safe care to her father because of the misinformation provided to her regarding her father’s medication management. On September 6, 2011, Mendelson met with the Plaintiff to discuss the August 29, 2011 complaint. The Plaintiff stated that she did, not believe the incorrect information provided to the wrong patient constituted a serious issue because “nothing happened to the patient.” Id. at ¶24.) Mendelson counseled the Plaintiff that there was a potential for a serious error in a situation like this, and advised the Plaintiff to collect her information and facts in a calm environment before providing instructions to patients or their family members via the telephone. Nevertheless, Mendelson acknowledged that the Plaintiff performed in a satisfactory manner as a nurse for VNSNY. *142O. The September 6, 2011 Letter On September 6, 2011, the Plaintiff sent a letter to Marian Haas, Vice President, Human Resources Policy &amp; Practice at VNSNY, in which she complained of discrimination and harassment. The Plaintiff alleged that Goldberg and Mendelson -denied or reduced her requests for vacation days; Goldberg and Mendelson denied her requests for sick leaves; Goldberg and Mendelson accused her of faking illness; Goldberg and Mendelson denied her bereavement leave request when her husband’s grandmother died; and that her suspension and performance improvement plan were discriminatory. Haas assigned Keir McMullen (“McMullen”), Employee Relations Specialist, and Silvia Viciedo (“Viciedo”), Manager, Human Resources, to investigate the Plaintiffs September 6, 2011 complaint. On September 28, 2011, Haas sent the Plaintiff a letter in which Haas stated that she received the Plaintiffs September 6, 2011 letter and that she had assigned McMullen and Viciedo to investigate the Plaintiffs September 6, 2011 allegations. On October 5, 2011 and October 12, 2011, McMullen and Viciedo met with the Plaintiff regarding her September 6, 2011 letter. McMullen and Viciedo were not involved in any disciplinary matters concerning the Plaintiff, including the Union grievance relating to her suspension. On November 15, 2011, McMullen and Viciedo advised Plaintiff that their investigation of Plaintiffs allegations in the September 6, 2011 Letter revealed no evidence of discrimination. P. The Grievance Meetings Following the imposition of the suspension, the Union filed a grievance on the Plaintiffs behalf, alleging that the suspension was improper. Pursuant to the grievance and arbitration process in the CBA, on October 6, 2011, the Plaintiff and her Union representatives, Roberts and Angela Kahn (“Kahn”), met with Goldberg, Haas, Mas-saro, and Ruiz to discuss the grievance the Union had filed regarding the Plaintiffs suspension from employment. Prior to this meeting, the Plaintiff spoke with Kahn. During the October 6, 2011 meeting, Kahn orally presented to VNSNY management a timeline of the Plaintiffs work day on May 20, 2011. Kahn stated to VNSNY management that on May 20, 2011, the Plaintiff began working in the field at 8:30 a.m. and was sitting in a parked car in front of a patient’s house for three hours, from 8:30 а.m. until 11:30 a.m. Kahn further stated to VNSNY management on the Plaintiffs behalf that her first patient on May 20, 2011 was diabetic and required an insulin injection. Kahn also stated to VNSNY management that the Plaintiff spent the three hours in her parked car in front of a patient’s home completing documentation. Of importance, the Plaintiff questions the adequacy of Kahn’s “representation” and states that some of what he represented during that meeting was, inaccurate, although she concedes she did not state anything to this effect during the October б, 2011 meeting. For example, the Plaintiff concedes that she did not spend the first three hours of her work day on May 20, 2011 completing documentation in her parked vehicle. Goldberg stated to Kahn, Roberts, and the Plaintiff that in May 2011, when she asked the Plaintiff to describe her patient visits on May 20, 2011, the Plaintiff reported that her visits on May 20, 2011 were at 9:30 a.m., 11:30 a.m., 12:45 p.m., 2:00 p.m., and 2:15 p.m. Haas handed Roberts a copy *143of the Plaintiffs visit signature report from May 20, 2011. Ruiz explained the visit signature report, which indicates that patients signed the Plaintiffs tablet, verifying that patient visits had occurred, on May 20, 2011 at 12:50 p.m., 1:05 p.m., 1:45 p.m., 2:10 p.m., and 5:51 p.m. VNSNY representatives also stated that the Plaintiff made 53 minutes of telephone calls from her VNSNY-issued cell phone on May 20, 2011, of which 26 minutes were work related and 27 minutes were personal. Following the October 6, 2011 meeting, VNSNY representatives informed the Plaintiff and the Union that the relevant documents would be reviewed and that they would respond further at a later point. VNSNY adjourned the grievance meeting to investigate the Union’s allegations during the October 6, 2011 meeting about the Plaintiffs whereabouts on May 20, 2011 Haas and Ruiz subsequently obtained and reviewed phone records for the Plaintiffs work-issued cell phone for May 20, 2011. On May 20, 2011, the Plaintiff had her VNSNY-issued cell phone with her the entire time she was working; she did not lend her VNSNY-issued cell phone to anyone during May 20, 2011; and she had no other cell phones with her on May 20, 2011 during the time she was working. VNSNY permitted nurses to make personal calls from their VNSNY-issued cell phone. The Plaintiff never made personal phone calls in the presence of VNSNY patients. The cell phone records showed that on May 20, 2011, the Plaintiff placed calls on her VNSNY-issued cell phone from Suffolk County until at least 9:32 a.m., which the Defendants claim is inconsistent with the Union’s and the Plaintiffs assertion that she was in her Massapequa-based patient care area at that time. The Plaintiff claims that between 9:30 and 10:30, she was driving from her home in Suffolk County to her work health area in Massa-pequa. On November 8, 2011, the Plaintiff met with Haas, Goldberg, Ruiz, and Union representative Raquel Webb-Geddes to discuss the documents that Goldberg, Ruiz, and Haas reviewed after the October 6, 2011 meeting. Haas showed the Plaintiff and the Union representatives certain telephone records for the Plaintiffs VNSNY-issued cell phone for May 20, 2011. Haas also showed the Plaintiff and the Union representatives a map and explained that VNSNY had marked the Plaintiffs whereabouts at different times on May 20, 2011 on the map using the Plaintiffs cell phone records. Haas told the Plaintiff and the Union representatives that the Plaintiffs VNSNY-issued cell phone records from May 20, 2011 showed that at 8:30 a.m., 8:34 a.m., 8:35 a.m., 8:38 a.m., and 9:32 a.m., on May 20, 2011, she made telephone calls to the VNSNY office while she was in Suffolk County. The Plaintiff did not respond to the timeline that the cell phone records showed. During the November 8, 2011 meeting, the Plaintiff conceded that portions of what her representatives said on her behalf at the October 6, 2011 meeting were not accurate. For instance, the Plaintiff stated that, contrary to Kahn’s prior representations, she did not sit in front of a patient’s home from 8:30 a.m. until 11:30 а.m. on May 20, 2011. Haas further told the Plaintiff and the Union representatives that the Plaintiffs representative stated, during the October б, 2011 meeting, that her first patient visit on May 20, 2011 took place 11:30 a.m., but that the Plaintiffs VNSNY-issued cell phone records for May 20, 2011 showed that on May 20, 2011, she was making and *144receiving calls on her VNSNY-issued cell phone between 11:34 a.m. and 12:24 p.m. The Plaintiff did not respond to this assertion. At the end of the November 8, 2011 meeting, Haas asked the Plaintiff if there was anything else she would like to say. The Plaintiff did not make any further comments. Hass ultimately denied the Union’s grievance challenging the Plaintiffs suspension. The Court notes that the Union has not filed a grievance challenging the Plaintiffs termination nor sought arbitration of the Plaintiffs grievance challenging the suspension. Q. The Termination of the Plaintiff’s Employment Also, on November 8, 2011, Haas terminated the Plaintiffs employment on the basis that she had misrepresented her whereabouts on May 20, 2011. The Plaintiff claims that Haas’s actions and motivations were guided by a desire to terminate her in retaliation for her complaints of discrimination. This action ensued. II. DISCUSSION A. The Legal Standard on Summary Judgment Summary judgment may not be granted unless all of the submissions taken together “show that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the mov-ant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). The moving party bears the burden of demonstrating the absence of a material factual question, and in making this determination, the court must view all facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and draw all reasonable inferences in that party’s favor. Nunn v. Mass. Cas. Ins. Co., 758 F.3d 109, 114 n. 4 (2d Cir.2014). Once the moving party has asserted facts showing that the non-movant’s claims cannot be sustained, the opposing party must set out specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial, and cannot rely merely on allegations or denials contained in the pleadings. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); accord Fabrikant v. French, 691 F.3d 193, 205 (2d Cir.2012). “Cjonclusory statements, conjecture, and inadmissible evidence are insufficient to defeat summary judgment.” Ridinger v. Dow Jones &amp; Co. Inc., 651 F.3d 309, 317 (2d Cir.2011) (citation omitted). In cases involving claims of employment discrimination, “an extra measure of caution is merited” in granting summary judgment because “direct evidence of discriminatory intent is rare and such intent often must be inferred from circumstantial evidence found in affidavits and depositions.” Schiano v. Quality Payroll Sys., Inc., 445 F.3d 597, 603 (2d Cir.2006) (citation omitted). Nonetheless, “a plaintiff must provide more than eonclusory allegations to resist a motion for summary judgment.” Holcomb v. Iona Coll., 521 F.3d 130, 137 (2d Cir.2008). Ultimately, the test for summary judgment is whether “a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.” Nunn, 758 F.3d at 114 n. 4 (citation omitted). B. The Title VII Claim of Discrimination The parties agree that, for purposes of summary judgment, the Plaintiffs claim of discriminatory termination is analyzed under the familiar burden-shifting framework set forth in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802-04, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). Under this framework, the plaintiff bears the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case by proving that (1) she is a member of a protected class; (2) she was *145qualified for her position; (3) she suffered an adverse employment action; and (4) the action occurred in circumstances giving rise to an inference of discrimination. See id. at 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817; Texas Dep’t of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 253, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981). The “burden of establishing a prima facie Title VII case is de minimis.” Sassaman v. Gamache, 566 F.3d 307, 312 (2d Cir.2009) (internal quotation and bracket marks omitted). If the plaintiff proves a prima facie case, the burden of production shifts to the employer to set forth a legitimate, non-diseriminatory reason for the adverse employment action. See Burdine, 450 U.S. at 254-55, 101 S.Ct. 1089. If the defendant makes this showing, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to demonstrate that the adverse action was based, “at least in part,” on discrimination. See Holcomb v. Iona Coll, 521 F.3d 130, 138, 141 (2d Cir.2008). Importantly, at this final step “the plaintiff is not required to show that the employer’s proffered reasons were false or played no role in the employment decision, but only that they were not the only reasons and that the prohibited factor was at least one of the motivating factors.” Id. at 141 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(m). Here, VNSNY concedes that the Plaintiff is a member of a protected class; that she was qualified for the position of VNSNY nurse; and that she suffered “adverse employment actions” in the form of her suspension and termination of employment. However, VNSNY contends that none of the other complained-of conduct constituted an “adverse employment action” and that, in any event, the circumstances surrounding each instance of complained-of action does not support an inference of discrimination. VNSNY further contends that, even if the Plaintiff could make out a prima facie case of discrimination, the Plaintiffs misrepresentation of her whereabouts on May, 20, 2011 and her pattern of unacceptably abbreviated patient visits supplied a legitimate reason for the suspension. Also, VNSNY contends that the Plaintiff allowing Kahn to make false statements on her behalf at the October 6, 2011 Grievance meeting supplied a legitimate reason for her termination. In essence, VNSNY contends that the Plaintiff cannot prove that it intentionally discriminated against her. The Court pauses to consider whether there were any additional “adverse employment actions” taken against the Plaintiff. A plaintiff suffers an “adverse employment action” under Title VII when “he or she endures a ‘materially adverse change’ in the terms and conditions of employment.” Galabya v. New York City Bd. of Educ., 202 F.3d 636, 640 (2d Cir.2000) (quoting Richardson v. N.Y. State Dep’t of Corr. Serv., 180 F.3d 426, 446 (2d Cir.1999)). A materially adverse change is a change in working conditions that is “more disruptive than a mere inconvenience or an alteration of job responsibilities.” Galabya, 202 F.3d at 640 (quoting Crady v. Liberty Nat’l Bank &amp; Trust Co. of Ind., 993 F.2d 132, 136 (7th Cir.1993)) (internal quotation marks omitted). “Examples of materially adverse employment actions include ‘termination of employment, a demotion evidenced by a decrease in wage or salary, a less distinguished title, a material loss of benefits, and significantly diminished material responsibilities ....’” Feingold v. New York, 366 F.3d 138, 152 (2d Cir.2004) (quoting Galabya, 202 F.3d at 640). In this case, the Plaintiff appears to argue that she suffered “adverse employment actions,” in addition to her suspension and termination, in that (1) she was denied sick leave, vacation time, and *146bereavement leave; (2) she was assigned too many cases; (3) VNSNY erroneously rewarded a white employee for the Plaintiffs Santrax compliance; (4) her supervisors wrongly accused her of misconduct; and (5) the PIP was applied unfairly to her. Even assuming any of these actions rose to the level of an “adverse employment action” as is required to state a traditional discrimination claim under Title VII, the Court finds that the Plaintiff has failed to establish a genuine issue of material fact that any occurred under circumstances giving rise to an inference of discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin. An inference of discrimination can be raised by “showing that an employer treated an employee less favorably than a similarly situated employee outside his protected group.” Abdul-Hakeem v. Parkinson, 523 Fed.Appx. 19, 20 (2d Cir.2013) (quoting Ruiz v. Cnty. of Rockland, 609 F.3d 486, 493 (2d Cir.2010)); see also Shlafer v. Wackenhut Corp., 837 F.Supp.2d 20, 25 (D.Conn.2011) (“Discriminatory motivation may be established by allegations of preferential treatment given to similarly situated individuals, or remarks conveying discriminatory animus.” (citations omitted)); Mabry v. Neighborhood Defender Serv., 769 F.Supp.2d 381, 392 (S.D.N.Y.2011) (“Allegations supporting motive may include preferential treatment given to similarly situated individuals....”). Such a showing “is a recognized method of raising an inference of discrimination for the purposes of making out a prima facie case.” Ruiz, 609 F.3d at 493 (internal quotation marks omitted) (italics added). “The ‘standard for comparing conduct requires a reasonably close resemblance of the facts and circumstances of plaintiffs and comparator’s cases,’ such that ‘the comparator must be similarly situated to the plaintiff in all material respects.’ ” Abdul-Hakeem, 523 Fed.Appx. at 21 (quoting Ruiz, 609 F.3d at 494); see also Ugactz v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., No. 10-CV-1247 (MKB), 2013 WL 1232355, at *16 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2013) (“Under Second Circuit law, where a plaintiff seeks to make out a case of discrimination by pointing to the disparate treatment of a purportedly similarly situated employee, the plaintiff must show that he shared sufficient employment characteristics with that comparator so that they could be considered similarly situated.” (alteration, citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). “An employee is similarly situated to co-employees if they were (1) subject to the same performance evaluation and discipline standards and (2) engaged in comparable conduct.” Abdul-Hakeem, 523 Fed.Appx. at 21 (quoting Ruiz, 609 F.3d at 493-94 (internal quotation marks omitted)); see also Graham v. Long Island R.R., 230 F.3d 34, 39-40 (2d Cir.2000) (“We have said that to satisfy Shumway v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 118 F.3d 60, 63 (2d Cir.1997) ‘all material respects’ standard for being similarly situated, a plaintiff must show that her co-employees were subject to the same performance evaluation and discipline standards. In addition, the standard we used in Shumway requires plaintiff to show that similarly situated employees who went undisciplined engaged in comparable conduct.” (citations omitted)). The determination of “whether other employees are similarly situated is a factual issue that should be submitted to a jury, but ‘this rule is not absolute ... and a court can properly grant summary judgment where it is clear that no reasonable jury could find the similarly situated prong met.’ ” Sweeney v. Leone, No. 05-CV-871 (PCD), 2006 WL 2246372, at *13 (D.Conn. July 31, 2006) *147(quoting Harlen Assoc. v. Inc. Vill. of Mineola, 273 F.3d 494, 499 n. 2 (2d Cir.2001)); see also Lugo v. City of New York, 518 Fed.Appx. 28, 30 (2d Cir.2013) (the plaintiff had not provided “any information from which a reasonable jury could conclude that the officers referenced were similarly situated to” the plaintiff). In this case, with regard to the alleged wrongful denials of sick leave, the Plaintiff fails to identify any non-black or non-Haitian nurses whose requests were treated more favorably. As to the denial of bereavement leave, the Plaintiff does not dispute that Mendel-son denied her request because leave for the passing of a grandparent of an employee’s spouse was not authorized under the CBA, but nonetheless claims that “Liz”— whose race, color, national origin, job title, and supervisors are unclear — was treated more favorably. However, the Plaintiff concedes that she does not know whether “Liz” received bereavement leave due to the passing of her own grandmother or that of her spouse. The Court also finds that the Plaintiff has failed to proffer sufficient evidence of “similarly situated” VNSNY employees who were denied vacation leave requests. Similarly, with regard to the Plaintiffs case load, she admits that she does not know how it compared to that of her colleagues. As noted above, the Plaintiff also alleges that Mendelson erroneously announced during a team meeting that a white nurse, Kim Macaluso (“Macaluso”), had achieved the highest percentage visits properly utilizing Santrax, and presented Macaluso with a $5 gift card. During the meeting, Desil brought to Mendelson’s attention that fact that she and the Plaintiff had, in fact, achieved the highest percentage. Mendelson subsequently awarded gift cards to both the Plaintiff and Desil. In any event, the Court finds that there is no evidence that this incident occurred under circumstances giving rise to an inference of discrimination on the basis of race, col- or, or national origin. The Plaintiff further alleges that Men-delson wrongfully accused her of various acts of misconduct, such as failing to record an amount of oxygen on a patient’s plan of care. However, she fails to point to “similarly situated” VNSNY employees who engaged in the same conduct yet were not wrongfully accused. Relatedly, the Plaintiff testified that a white coworker, Patrice Perricone, brought her into the field for a client visit, yet VNSNY attempted to discipline the Plaintiff for Perricone’s conduct and that when VNSNY realized this error, it took no such action against Perricone. While a rational juror could find that this is evidence of disparate treatment on the basis of race or color, at least for purposes of a prima facie case, the Court declines to find that VNSNYs failure to discipline Perricone based on this isolated incident constituted a materially adverse change in the Plaintiffs working conditions. The Court next considers whether there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the Plaintiffs suspension and termination — which VNSNY concedes qualify as “adverse employment actions”— occurred under circumstances giving rise to an inference of discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin. The Court concludes that no such genuine issue of material fact exists. Indeed, not only is there no direct evidence in the summary judgment record of such discrimination — for example, in the form of derogatory or offensive remarks made to anyone or that any VNSNY employee believed that the Plaintiff was being *148treated differently due to her race, color, or national origin — the Plaintiff has failed, in the Court’s view, to come forward with sufficient circumstantial evidence of discrimination to survive summary judgment on this claim. In this regard, the Plaintiff offers no evidence that VNSNY failed to discipline “similarly situated” non-black or non-Haitians nurses who engaged in comparable conduct. Indeed, she identifies no other nurse accused of dishonesty. The Plaintiffs accusation that the white nurse Horrigan failed to provide proper care to the catheter patient is of little assistance to her. The accusation itself is based on inadmissible hearsay derived from an unsworn, out-of-court comment from a non-party home health aide. “It is well settled that the evidence considered in connection with a summary judgment motion must be admissible at trial.” Dabney v. Christmas Tree Shops, 958 F.Supp.2d 439, 451 (S.D.N.Y.2013) affd sub nom. Dabney v. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, 588 Fed.Appx. 15 (2d Cir.2014). However, even if the comment could be considered, the Plaintiff offers no evidence that VNSNY believed a lapse of this nature warranted any discipline, let alone termination. Nor does the Plaintiff allege that Horrigan was ever questioned about this incident or lied about it; or that he was suspected of abbreviated patient visits, or misrepresenting his whereabouts. Absent such evidence, the Plaintiff has failed to show that they were “similarly situated” in all material respects. Uribe v. Kellogg’s Snacks/Keebler, Inc., No. 05 CIV. 02959(PGG), 2009 WL 1098369, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 22, 2009) (“Ordinarily, where a plaintiff attempts to establish a prima facie case by showing that he received unwarranted discipline, he must ‘show that similarly situated employees who went undisciplined engaged in comparable conduct.’ ”) (quoting Graham v. Long Island R.R., 230 F.3d 34, 40 (2d Cir.2000)). The Court also takes note of portions of the Plaintiffs deposition wherein she expressed her belief that the VNSNY did not discriminate against her based on her national origin. This admission is illustrative of the Plaintiffs failure to present even minimal proof that her suspension and termination were driven, even in part, by discrimination. See Ponticelli v. Zurich Am. Ins. Grp., 16 F.Supp.2d 414, 427 (S.D.N.Y.1998) (“Additionally, Ponticelli has not demonstrated that gender was the reason Fishman terminated her. In fact, at her deposition, Ponticelli admitted that Fishman did not say or do anything that could lead her to believe that he might have fired her because she is a woman.”). The Plaintiff minimizes the import of this admission, arguing that her perceptions or subjective views are not disposi-tive in determining whether discrimination in violation of Title VII occurred. To the extent the Plaintiff argues that the ultimate determination of discrimination rests within the province of the factfinder, the Court agrees. However, it does not follow that the Plaintiffs perceptions are not relevant to whether a genuine issue of material fact exists on this type of claim. Relatedly, the Plaintiffs attempt to recant this portion of her testimony by a later-filed affidavit “runs into the well-established rule in this circuit that a party may not evade summary judgment by proffering an affidavit (or declaration) that directly contradicts the affiant’s prior deposition testimony.” Edge Grp. WAICCS LLC v. Sapir Grp. LLC, 705 F.Supp.2d 304, 320 (S.D.N.Y.2010); Gorzynski v. Jet-Blue Airways Corp., 596 F.3d 93, 104 (2d Cir.2010) (citing Perma Research and Dev. Co. v. Singer Co., 410 F.2d 572, 578 (2d Cir.1969)); Bickerstaff v. Vassar Coll., 196 F.3d 435, 454-55 (2d Cir.1999) (citing *149Hayes v. New York City Dep’t of Corr., 84 F.3d 614, 619 (2d Cir.1996)). In sum, the Court finds that the Plaintiff has failed to establish a genuine issue of material fact as to whether her suspension or termination, or any other potential “adverse employment action,” occurred under circumstances giving rise to an inference of discrimination on the basis of race, col- or, or national origin. Having concluded that the Plaintiff failed to discharge her burden of proving a prima facie case of discrimination under Title VII, the Court need not address whether VNSNY has proffered legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for any “adverse employment action.” Accordingly, the Court grants that part of VNSNY’s motion for summary judgment dismissing the Plaintiffs Title VII discrimination claim. C. The Title VII Claim of Retaliation “Retaliation claims under Title VII follow the familiar burden-shifting analysis set out in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973).” Cummings-Fowler v. Suffolk Cnty. Cmty. Coll., 588 Fed.Appx. 32, 33-34 (2d Cir.2014). If the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of retaliation, then a rebuttable presumption of retaliation arises and the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate a “legitimate non-retaliatory” reason for the employment decision. El Sayed v. Hilton Hotels Corp., 627 F.3d 931, 932 (2d Cir.2010). The burden then shifts back to the plaintiff to prove that his or her protected activity “was a but-for cause of an adverse employment action, for example, by demonstrating weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, or contradictions in the employer’s proffered legitimate nonretaliatory reasons for its action.” Zann Kwan v. Andalex Grp. LLC, 737 F.3d 834, 846 (2d Cir.2013). In order to establish a prima facie case, “a plaintiff claiming retaliation in violation of Title VII must prove: (1) participation in a protected activity; (2) that the defendant knew of the protected activity; (3) an adverse employment action; and (4) a causal connection between plaintiffs protected activity and the adverse employment action.” Gordon v. N.Y.C. Board of Education, 232 F.3d 111, 113 (2d Cir.2000). At the summary judgment stage the plaintiffs burden of establishing a prima facie case of employment discrimination is “de minimis.” Zimmermann v. Associates First Capital Corp., 251 F.3d 376, 381 (2d Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). “In determining whether this initial burden is satisfied in a Title VII retaliation claim, the court’s role in evaluating a summary judgment request is to determine only whether proffered admissible evidence would be sufficient to permit a rational finder of fact to infer a retaliatory motive.” Jute v. Hamilton Sundstrand Corp., 420 F.3d 166, 173 (2d Cir.2005). In this case, the Plaintiff pioints to three instances of protected activity after her suspension: (1) the June 3, 2011 letter sent by her attorneys to VNSNY alleging race discrimination; (2) the August 25, 2011 charge of discrimination with the NYSDHR; and (3) the September 6, 2011 letter to Haas. VNSNY argues that, even assuming the Plaintiff has established the first three elements of a prima facie claim of discrimination under Title VII, she has failed to establish the requisite causal connection between these alleged protected activities and any “adverse employment actions.” The Court agrees. Viewing the record in the light most favorable to the Plaintiff as the non-moving party, the Court notes that there is a significant intervening event — the Plaintiffs acquiescence in Kahn’s misrepresen*150tations during the October 6, 2011 Grievance meeting — that gave VNSNY grounds to terminate Plaintiff, particularly given that, as a result of those representations, VNSNY expended additional resources on further internal investigation. The Plaintiff does not dispute that she failed to correct Kahn’s misrepresentations either during or immediately after the Grievance meeting, despite contacting VNSNY regarding perceived misstatements made by VNSNY representatives. The Plaintiff concedes that not until she was confronted on November 8, 2011 with documentary evidence exposing these misrepresentations did she admit that Kahn had made false statements at the prior meeting. “This intervening event dispels an inference of a causal relationship between the protected activity and Plaintiff’s termination, thus defeating Plaintiffs prima facie case of unlawful retaliation.” Rivera v. Thurston Foods, Inc., 933 F.Supp.2d 330, 342 (D.Conn.2013); see also Yarde v. Good Samaritan Hosp., 360 F.Supp.2d 552, 562 (S.D.N.Y.2005) (“In this Circuit, an inference of causation is defeated ... if ... there was an intervening causal event.”). In other words, the Plaintiffs conduct during the October 6, 2011 grievance meeting, in failing to correct Kahn’s false statements, was sufficient to justify her termination. Therefore, that conduct “breaks any chain of causation” between her protected activity and her termination. See Hahn v. Bank of Am. Inc., 2014 WL 1285421, at *19, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 45886, at *57 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 31, 2014). The Court further notes that, in her deposition, the Plaintiff conceded that she did not believe that she was fired because of the June 2011 letter or the September 6, 2011 letter. For the reasons explained previously, the Plaintiff cannot now establish a genuine issue of material fact based on an affidavit that contradicts her prior deposition testimony. The Court also notes that it is undisputed that the VNSNY employees investigating the allegations in the Plaintiffs September 6, 2011 Letter played no role in the decision to terminate Plaintiffs employment. In sum, the Court finds that the Plaintiff has failed to establish a genuine issue of material fact as to whether any other potential “adverse employment action” occurred in retaliation for filing any of her complaints of discrimination. Having concluded that the Plaintiff failed to discharge her burden of proving a prima facie case of retaliation under Title VII, the Court need not address whether VNSNY has proffered legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for any “adverse employment action.” Accordingly, the Court grants that part of VNSNY’s motion for summary judgment dismissing the Plaintiffs Title VII retaliation claim. III. CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, VNSNY’s motion for summary judgment is granted; the amended complaint is dismissed; and the Clerk of the Court is respectfully directed to close the case.
